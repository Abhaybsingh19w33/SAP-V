1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:05,565
Let's now take a look at how we can format
a single line on the screen.

2
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:10,360
And when we define individual lines for

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,170
our selection screen, we need to define
the start and end of each line.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:20,280
And in between the start and end, we
include the specific parameters and

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,570
select option statements.

6
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,100
So let's have a look at the code.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:32,140
Let's see how the screen looks at the
moment, and then we can maybe tidy it up.

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,294
Okay, so that's the first line,

9
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,989
the employee output.

10
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:46,369
So let's start the code here.

11
00:00:46,369 --> 00:00:50,274
So to begin with, what we do is type

12
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:55,270
SELECTION-SCREEN and then BEGIN OF LINE.

13
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,836
And then to define the end of our line,

14
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:07,732
we do SELECTION-SCREEN,

15
00:01:07,732 --> 00:01:11,702
it would help if, spelt it properly
wouldn't it?

16
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:15,700
SELECTION-SCREEN, and as you may guess,
just END OF LINE.

17
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:23,310
So now anything between the begin and end
will all appear on one line.

18
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,715
So let's change the three lines in
between.

19
00:01:26,715 --> 00:01:32,510
Or two lines, [LAUGH] first of all we have
a comment.

20
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:38,560
And we'll say this is going to start,
position one.

21
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,660
We don't want to, a new line there.

22
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,580
It's going to be 15 characters long, and
it will contain the word surname.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:52,440
If you remember text001, contains the
value surname.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,480
Here we go.

25
00:01:57,045 --> 00:01:58,975
And that will be followed by another
comment.

26
00:02:00,205 --> 00:02:06,046
And we'll say lets start this at position
20, and that's gonna be for

27
00:02:06,046 --> 00:02:12,675
a length of 10, and that's gonna contain
the value stored in variable comm1.

28
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:19,002
Which as we saw earlier gets assigned
during the initialization

29
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:24,284
session of the program, and that will say
hello SAP.

30
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,120
And then lastly, let's start another line.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:32,470
And let's just define a brand new
parameter.

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,790
Lets define a parameter called ABC, and
we'll make

33
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,010
it a character data type with a length of
5.

34
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,980
And if you remember when we

35
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:52,000
define character data types we don't have
to define it as a type c.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Because that's implied because it's the
default.

37
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,690
So I'll just leave it in the short form.

38
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,190
Just like that.

39
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,204
And that's it.

40
00:03:00,204 --> 00:03:05,707
[BLANK_AUDIO]

41
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:07,461
Let's see what it looks like.

42
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:11,348
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:14,808
So there you can see, we have our first
field.

44
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:18,048
Or our first comment, and our second
comment.

45
00:03:18,048 --> 00:03:19,801
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:23,086
And then the parameter field, all
displayed on one line.

47
00:03:23,086 --> 00:03:25,304
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:03:25,304 --> 00:03:32,500
So anything between the BEGIN OF LINE and
END OF LINE can all be put on one line.

49
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,380
And all you need to do is make sure you
get your positioning and

50
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,690
length parameters correct.

51
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:42,870
Now those of you who have your eyes peeled
you may have noticed something.

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,880
Let's go back to the screen.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,280
See here we defined the parameter field,
but

54
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,670
see how it didn't automatically get
assigned a comment or

55
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:00,030
description that refers to the technical
name of the field.

56
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,858
Well, that's because we used specific
comments on the line.

57
00:04:04,858 --> 00:04:08,353
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:04:08,353 --> 00:04:13,080
So whenever you use the BEGIN OF LINE and
END OF LINE to define the line on

59
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:19,370
the screen, the selection text itself that
describes the element is not displayed.

60
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,420
And that's when you would use the comments

61
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,630
to create your own description on the
line.

62
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:32,130
Now one more addition I want to show you
right here is, and the, and this can only

63
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:37,720
be used when you are at the BEGIN OF LINE
and END OF LINE, is the position addition.

64
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,260
Now to be fair,

65
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:45,720
I don't see this being used an awful lot
because the different elements of our

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:50,830
screen allow you to specify the position
of the element within its own syntax.

67
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,810
But we do have the option of

68
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,170
specifying the position of the next
element separately.

69
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,100
So we would do SELECTION-SCREEN.

70
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,110
And then we would include position, and

71
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:11,660
then we can specify the position using an
integer.

72
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,112
So we could say position 35.

73
00:05:15,112 --> 00:05:25,039
[BLANK_AUDIO]

74
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,564
And if we include a parameter straight
after this position,

75
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:33,304
then our parameter will appear in position
35.

76
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,612
Let's check it out.
Now its hard to see here but

77
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:44,792
let me step back, I'll tell you what I'll
do,

78
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:48,845
let's comment out these two.

79
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:56,480
I do apologize.

80
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:05,495
Tell you what, instead of commenting them
out [LAUGH] let's move them down.

81
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:13,020
So there you can see the parameter was
positioned at column 35.

82
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,640
Now that just so happens to be in line
with these.

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,406
So let's just change it a little bit.

84
00:06:19,406 --> 00:06:20,634
Let's choose 30.

85
00:06:20,634 --> 00:06:25,315
[BLANK_AUDIO]

86
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,750
And now you can see we've moved it a back
a little bit.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,440
Now we do have something else to add on to
the position.

88
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,910
And that is we have some I guess you call
them constants that we can use.

89
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,630
So by default we'll go back to the screen.

90
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,860
We can see we have a default position
here, and we have a default position here.

91
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,560
Well this is referred to as position low,
and this is position high.

92
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,610
Now we can use these default positions
with our position addition.

93
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:07,100
And all we need to do is add pos.

94
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,100
I'll tell you what I'll do.

95
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:14,740
I'll choose pos_high first and it's pos
underscore high.

96
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,141
[BLANK_AUDIO]

97
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:22,848
And what you'll see is when we execute the
program

98
00:07:22,848 --> 00:07:27,340
our parameter is lined with the high
position.

99
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,860
So if you are defining your own fields,
and

100
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,080
you want them all to line up just as they
do with the select option,

101
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,076
you can use the pos_high so you don't have
to remember the actual value.

102
00:07:38,076 --> 00:07:43,035
[SOUND] And the pos_low, well that

103
00:07:43,035 --> 00:07:48,337
will bring it in line with the first.

104
00:07:48,337 --> 00:07:49,602
There we go.

105
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:53,479
[BLANK_AUDIO]
