1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,580
We are now gonna move straight on, and
start looking at some of the ABAP

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,620
code that we will use to generate our
selection screens.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,829
So I'll start by creating a brand new
program, I'll call this Z_SCREEN_1.

4
00:00:13,829 --> 00:00:23,829
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,980
Okay, we have our blank reports.

6
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,140
And the first thing we're gonna do is have
a look at the initialization event.

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,720
If you remember, the initialization event

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:00,225
is the first thing that gets triggered in
our program, the first event block.

9
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:07,095
So, if we recall, we have a employee table
that we set up in the system.

10
00:01:08,585 --> 00:01:12,745
And let's say, for our program, we would
like to know

11
00:01:12,745 --> 00:01:16,965
the last employee number that was used to
create an employee record.

12
00:01:18,105 --> 00:01:23,610
Now, the initialization event is the ideal
place for this type of code.

13
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:26,880
So we can find out what the last employee
number was, and

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,280
display to the user on the selection
screen, so

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,350
that they know not to select any values
greater than that last employee number.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,190
So let's start off, we'll just Save, and
check everything.

17
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,503
Let's start off, and then declare the
table statement,

18
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:50,060
because what we're going to do is read
records from our z employees table.

19
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,274
So we'll declare the tables that we're
going to use, z employees.

20
00:01:56,274 --> 00:02:00,419
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:03,480
And let's declare a data statement.

22
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:07,417
So we can hold the value of the last
employee number that has been used in

23
00:02:07,417 --> 00:02:08,098
the table.

24
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:16,144
[BLANK_AUDIO]

25
00:02:16,144 --> 00:02:19,210
So wa_employees has like a work area.

26
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:23,390
We'll use the like statement to reference
our table, and

27
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,840
the field is going to be the employee
field.

28
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,540
Now, this is where we create our
initialization section.

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,650
So what we need to do is type in

30
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,900
initialization, and then we start writing
our code.

31
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,293
So, to get the last employee number, we'll
use a select statement,

32
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:54,909
let's just use a generic one, we'll select
all the fields even though,

33
00:02:54,909 --> 00:02:57,828
all we need is the employee number field.

34
00:02:57,828 --> 00:03:05,548
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:03:05,548 --> 00:03:09,068
And because this is going to be a select
loop,

36
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:13,608
what we're going to do is populate our
work area field to be

37
00:03:13,608 --> 00:03:18,720
wa_employee with a value of the employee
number from the table.

38
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,865
So we will say wa_employee

39
00:03:23,865 --> 00:03:31,030
equals z_employees dash employee.

40
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:35,990
Then we will end our select statement, and
that's about it.

41
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:41,648
Let's just pretty it up or check.

42
00:03:41,648 --> 00:03:47,740
Hm, that's a refreshing change, no, no
typos.

43
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,200
So what this is gonna do, when our program
is run, the run-time environment

44
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:58,040
will realize we have an initialization
event block, and

45
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:01,050
execute the code in this event block.

46
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:06,729
And that's gonna be select every record
from the z employees table, and populate,

47
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:11,910
our work area field to be y employee with
the employee number field.

48
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,470
And that's all there is to it.

49
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,191
Lets just test this piece out, that's what
we'll do,

50
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:24,822
is just a simple write statement, and we
will write out wa_employee to the screen.

51
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,788
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:04:27,788 --> 00:04:31,535
Now, just comment out the initialization,
so it's a standard program.

53
00:04:31,535 --> 00:04:37,155
[SOUND] So I'll press F8 to execute, and

54
00:04:37,155 --> 00:04:45,100
there you can see the last number being
used in our table.

55
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:50,646
So as a reminder, the select statement is
a loop, okay.

56
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,120
It's not picking up all the records, and
putting it in a table.

57
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,600
It's going to process the records one at a
time.

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,050
So what'll it do, it'll read the first
record, populate this work area field,

59
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,470
come to the end of the select statement,
and then start again.

60
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,320
And it'll continue that loop until the
last record in the table has been read.

61
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,170
And then it will write our wa employee
work at your variable to the screen.

62
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:22,235
So now, we have the last employee number
stored in a variable,

63
00:05:22,235 --> 00:05:28,180
let's get rid of this write statement, and
put back in the initialization.

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,914
We can move on, and take a look at the at
selection screen event.

65
00:05:34,914 --> 00:05:35,414
