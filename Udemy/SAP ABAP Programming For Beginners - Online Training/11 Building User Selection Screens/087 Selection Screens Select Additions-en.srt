1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,800
As with most ABAP statements in SAP,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:08,160
we have a number of additions we can
include with the select option statement.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,381
So let's have a look at those.

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:20,770
So very similar to the parameters
statement,

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,127
the select options also has

6
00:00:25,127 --> 00:00:31,005
the obligatory [SOUND] also lower case

7
00:00:31,005 --> 00:00:41,836
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:45,530
And some more, but they are very similar
to the parameters, so

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:48,730
we don't really need to go through them.

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,610
They all work in exactly the same way, no
difference whatsoever.

11
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:58,750
Now the one thing I do want to discuss
though,

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,630
is a no extensions edition.

13
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:08,545
This allows us to prevent the use of
making multiple selections.

14
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:14,130
So we can still give the user the ability
to make our value range selection.

15
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:18,460
But we can stop them from entering
multiple value ranges

16
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,620
and it's quite straightforward.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,420
This is how we do it.

18
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,223
All we do is our no extensions onto

19
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:32,458
our sort option statement.

20
00:01:32,458 --> 00:01:39,045
[SOUND] Let's activate our code take a
look and low and behold.

21
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,010
That additional button has now
disappeared.

22
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:46,810
We can still do our individual value and
include one range.
