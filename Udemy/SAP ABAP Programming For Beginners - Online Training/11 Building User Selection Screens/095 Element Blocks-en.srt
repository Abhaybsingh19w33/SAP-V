1
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:04,060
This video is going to be about element
logs.

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,370
And when we define selection screens for

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,500
our users, it's common practice to group
certain fields together.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,670
And we can use these element blocks

5
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,510
which will draw frames around the groups
of fields we choose.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,060
We also have the option of adding frame
labels.

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,360
As we take a look at element blocks,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,200
bear in mind that you can nest element
blocks within other blocks,

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:35,860
allowing you to subdivide individual
sections of your screen.

10
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:42,550
Let's get straight onto the code and you
can see how element blocks get defined.

11
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,770
So this is the program we've been working
on.

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,460
And in the previous videos we had a look
at the begin of line edition.

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:56,630
Well element blocks are very similar.

14
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,890
So what we will do is key in selection
screen.

15
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,230
Then instead of begin of line we just
write begin of block.

16
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,100
And what we do, we then add a name.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,210
So we give our block a name.

18
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:21,420
We'll call this my block one.

19
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:29,220
As you can see, the syntax is very basic
and it looks very similar to the begin of

20
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,720
line with just that one addition of
defining a block name.

21
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,901
Now you have the option of choosing
whether you want to apply a frame around

22
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:42,597
a block of fields in your selection
screen.

23
00:01:42,597 --> 00:01:46,194
We do that by using the width frame
edition.

24
00:01:46,194 --> 00:01:49,047
So let's add that in.

25
00:01:49,047 --> 00:01:51,790
So all we do is type width frame.

26
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:52,915
Simple.

27
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:53,971
Pretty it up.

28
00:01:53,971 --> 00:01:57,884
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:01:57,884 --> 00:02:01,803
And now another addition is we can add a
frame label.

30
00:02:01,803 --> 00:02:04,235
And we call these labels titles.

31
00:02:04,235 --> 00:02:06,005
So we add a title to the frame.

32
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:11,045
And as with comments we can use text
symbols or

33
00:02:11,045 --> 00:02:13,659
field names with a maximum length of eight
characters.

34
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,670
Type in the addition title, and then we
add add the text elements.

35
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,200
Now because we defined the start of a
block, with the begin block addition.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,550
We also have to remember to include an
ender block.

37
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,240
So, let's copy this line.

38
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,740
And we'll go down and let's put the ender
block here.

39
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,429
Let's group these together and there we
have a block.

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:57,190
And instead of beginner block, all we do
is type, you'll never guess, end of block.

41
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,430
Again, keep the block name to define which
block you're ending.

42
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,230
And then a full stop.

43
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:11,180
Let's check our code and see what it looks
like.

44
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,530
And there you go, you can see we defined a
frame.

45
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:19,940
We gave it a title, and

46
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,960
it's picking up the text element, which
has the text surname.

47
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:29,560
And now your screen starts to look, well,

48
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,740
I won't say a whole lot better [LAUGH] but
it starts to look a bit better.

49
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,980
Element blocks help give your field some
context, and

50
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,590
to help group your fields together.

51
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,380
And you'll see them used all over the
place in SAP.

52
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,920
So when you're designing your screens keep
element blocks in mind.

53
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,230
Make sure you make use of them,

54
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:55,200
because it looks a lot better from the
user's perspective.

55
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,460
So we have looked at many different
elements of designing screens

56
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,030
for our programs.

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:06,520
We've discussed events parameters, select
options How we can use text elements,

58
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,660
to saving variance, and how the user can
actually change the screen layout as well.

59
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,450
And then finally how we, let's say, pretty
up our screens.

60
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,980
Group fields together.

61
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,290
Make it look a lot more presentable to the
user.

62
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,320
And that covers our selection screen
statement.
