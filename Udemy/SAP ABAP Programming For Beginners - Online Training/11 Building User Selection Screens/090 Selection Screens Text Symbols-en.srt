1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:06,050
There are a couple more things we need to
look at to complete covering text objects

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:10,180
in general to enable you to completely set
up your own selection screens for

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,680
your programs.

4
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,020
These are text symbols and messages.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,980
So what are these?

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,030
Well, text symbols were used to replace
literals in our program.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:29,780
For example, when we use the right
statement, we can choose to use text

8
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,375
symbols, which will enable us to reuse
text we have already set up.

9
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:40,315
And it gives us the added functionality of
being able to use translated text

10
00:00:40,315 --> 00:00:41,145
within our program.

11
00:00:42,315 --> 00:00:47,475
So basically we stay away from using any
hard coded literals in our program, and

12
00:00:47,475 --> 00:00:48,705
use text symbols instead.

13
00:00:50,425 --> 00:00:52,539
Now let me go back into SE-38.

14
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,340
And we'll have a look at our program.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,390
And we'll discuss, well, what are text
symbols.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,795
Well, quite simply, they are just place
holders for text

17
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:09,057
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:17,392
Instead of having a write statement such
as [NOISE] let's say,

19
00:01:17,392 --> 00:01:22,040
write new line surname as a title,

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:26,541
we can use a text symbol instead.

21
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:31,993
And we would do this by creating our right
statement again,

22
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:36,248
but instead of having a literal same
surname,

23
00:01:36,248 --> 00:01:40,300
we would say use text dash and then a
number.

24
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:44,660
And this represents a text symbol that we
can set up.

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,100
Now it's important you take note how the
text symbol is declared.

26
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,448
You must use text, which is this word
here,

27
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:59,032
followed by a three digit number.

28
00:01:59,032 --> 00:02:03,049
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,881
[SOUND] You are allowed to use up to 1,000
text symbols in your program,

30
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:14,357
of which each one can be translated into
as many languages as you wish.

31
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:18,857
Now, there is a limitation to the length
of a text symbol and

32
00:02:18,857 --> 00:02:21,110
that's 132 characters.

33
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,420
But as you can imagine, that's probably
enough for

34
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,150
any situation you'll come up against.

35
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,170
Now we have already seen how to get to
text elements

36
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,230
by using the menus when we had a look at
selection text.

37
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,020
But there is also another way we can get
to it.

38
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,220
And that's by using forward navigation.

39
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,450
So because I have just used this text
double one, I can use forward

40
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,300
navigation just like when we did with
creating a database table.

41
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,770
You know, when we created the data
elements and

42
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,770
the fields, we use forward navigation to
actually create objects.

43
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,870
We can do the same here.

44
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,242
So all I'll need to do is double-click
this text-001.

45
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:10,120
And now the system says do you want to
create the object.

46
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,940
We'll choose Yes.

47
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,090
And yes, we'll save the program first so
we don't lose it.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,860
And now it takes us straight into our text
element screen.

49
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:25,670
You can see it's using the code 001 that
we defined in the program, and

50
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:29,600
now all we need to do is enter some basic
text into this field.

51
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,915
Now, previously we used surname as our
text, so let's do the same.

52
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,046
[SOUND] Let's just use surname.

53
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:43,250
The field here on the right, D-length,
that's just the length.

54
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,330
I've just pressed enter, and

55
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,070
that's just the length of the text that
we've keyed in.

56
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:50,320
In the field on the far right is the
maximum length.

57
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,930
So let's activate this object.

58
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,544
Now we can step back to our program.

59
00:03:58,544 --> 00:04:00,726
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:07,330
And what I'll do, just in this example,
let's just remove the select statements.

61
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,510
What else have we got in the program?

62
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,990
That's fine.
We'll leave the selection screen in and

63
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:19,120
we'll run this report and then you'll see
the word surname output twice.

64
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,410
First by our write statement outputting a
literal, and

65
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,960
then by who's using the text symbol.

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,480
I'll activate the program.

67
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:36,600
Press F8, click execute, and there you can
see, surname is output twice.

68
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:40,330
First by the literal and then by our tech
symbol.

69
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:48,710
So as you can see, tech symbols are super
easy, super easy to define and set up.

70
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,920
And I advise you do use them wherever you
can,

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,670
because if you ever need to change any
text that you have up on the screen,

72
00:04:56,670 --> 00:05:00,740
you can just change the text symbol value
without having to recompile your program.

73
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:06,770
And plus, it has the added benefit of
allowing you to use translations for

74
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:07,360
other languages
