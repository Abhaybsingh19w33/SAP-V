1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:07,420
We will now take a look at how we can
format our selection screens.

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:12,475
And this will help us make our selection
screens look a lot more attractive and

3
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,045
intuitive to the user.

4
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:18,564
You already know how to make parameters
and select options appear on the screen,

5
00:00:18,564 --> 00:00:21,760
but you haven't included any specific
layout options.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,420
Yes, you have seen the objects on the
screen,

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,580
but the system has determined where it
places them all itself.

8
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:34,210
And this type of layout more often than
not is not sufficient.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,050
For example,

10
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:41,070
when you group a group of radio buttons
together, you should group these and

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:45,980
separate them from other input fields so
the user can identify them as a group.

12
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:48,830
So how do we do this?

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,050
Well, pretty simple.

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,250
We start to look at using the selection
screen statement.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,700
Now, this statement has its own formatting
options

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,840
that you can use to define the layout for
your selection screens.

17
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:07,860
It allows you to define the layout of
parameters and selection criteria and

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,470
display comments and underlines on the
selection screen.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:15,810
Now, the selection screen statement needs
to have additions

20
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,700
with it that specify the specific type of
layout option you are defining.

21
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:25,878
So let's take a look.

22
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:32,920
That's our code, and we will go through
some examples to show how it all works.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:39,336 --> 00:01:44,092
So the first thing we're going to do is
locate the place in our program

25
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,295
where we start to specify the screen
layouts.

26
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:50,800
And this is here, where we have the
parameter statements.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,720
Now, the selection screen statement is a
very simple syntax.

28
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,740
It is just SELECTION-SCREEN.

29
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,740
Can't be much easier than that.

30
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,753
But then we have additions.

31
00:02:05,753 --> 00:02:08,600
So the first thing we're going to look at
is blank lines.

32
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,480
So if we want to insert a blank line
between parameters and things like that,

33
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,353
we would use, the SKIP addition.

34
00:02:19,353 --> 00:02:26,520
And what we do is actually specify the
number of lines we want to skip,

35
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,711
and that's represented here, in these
square brackets.

36
00:02:32,711 --> 00:02:38,960
Now, the simplest form is actually to
leave the number of lines out,

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:45,128
and just by using SKIP, that will mean we
just want to skip one line.

38
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:50,182
Now, before I run the program, I'm gonna
move this selection screen line,

39
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:54,302
because this would place a blank line at
the top of our report and

40
00:02:54,302 --> 00:02:56,350
it'll be a little hard to see.

41
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:03,042
So I'm gonna move this and I'm just gonna
place it right here,

42
00:03:03,042 --> 00:03:08,670
which means I'm breaking the chain
statement for parameters.

43
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:14,379
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:20,003
There we go.

45
00:03:20,003 --> 00:03:24,195
So I'll save, do a check, and

46
00:03:24,195 --> 00:03:27,753
then execute the report.

47
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:31,922
So you can see here, we have the employee
number parameter,

48
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:35,460
then we have a blank line where we skipped
one line.

49
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,380
And then we get the check box and radio
buttons.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,920
So it's pretty simple.

51
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,210
You just place it where you want it to
appear between the individual fields that

52
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:50,160
you're outputting on the screen.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,378
Now, if we wanted to skip two lines, we
have the number 2.

54
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:03,295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:09,336
And as you can see in the test, we now
have two lines.

56
00:04:09,336 --> 00:04:13,984
Now the next addition I want to show you
is how we add a vertical

57
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,545
line to the screen.

58
00:04:15,545 --> 00:04:19,643
So I'm just gonna copy the selection

59
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:24,540
screen statement and just add another one.

60
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,570
But this time, instead of SKIP 2, I'm
going to add ULINE.

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,860
Do a save, and as you can guess, ULINE
means underline.

62
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,800
Check activate and execute, and there you
can see we have added a horizontal line.

63
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,212
Very simple stuff.

64
00:04:50,212 --> 00:04:54,170
[BLANK_AUDIO]

65
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:57,111
There are some additions we can add to the
underline, and

66
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:59,020
these are quite easy to understand.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,220
We have a position and a length addition.

68
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,370
So on the example we've got, I will show
you first of all,

69
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:17,520
we can either slash, which actually gives
us a brand new line, then we can add

70
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,630
the position, let's say position 1, which
is the first character on the screen, and

71
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,860
then we can give it a length, let's say
just eight characters long.

72
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,240
We'll give it a check.

73
00:05:34,392 --> 00:05:37,379
And then activate, and then give it a
test.

74
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:40,030
And there you can see, just eight
characters long.

75
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,500
If we wanted to move it into the middle of
the screen,

76
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,230
all we would do is change the initial
position.

77
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,753
So let's say we want to move it 40
characters along.

78
00:05:53,753 --> 00:05:56,090
Let's activate and test.

79
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:57,950
And there you can see.
