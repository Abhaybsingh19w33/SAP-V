1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:03,990
Next up, we'll take a look at comments.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,230
And comments are just to allow you to
place text on the screen

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,500
without actually placing a field.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:13,310
You know, it's just standard text.

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,575
So to place comments on the selection
screen, we would use the following syntax.

6
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:22,851
[SOUND] We do

7
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:27,219
the selection

8
00:00:27,219 --> 00:00:31,953
screen again.

9
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:35,552
And then we use the addition comment.

10
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:41,285
And as with the underline, we can also say
put our comments on the new line,

11
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:45,160
and we can give it starting position.

12
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,510
Let's say 40 characters long, and then we
can give it a length.

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,220
Let's say our comment will be 15
characters in length.

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,630
And then, we just need to add our
comments.

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:03,090
You can either use a text symbol,

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,810
which we've already looked at creating in
a previous video, or a field name.

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,410
But your field name has to be a maximum
length of eight characters.

18
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:18,540
And this character field must not be
declared with the data statement.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,060
But it is generated automatically when we
declare the length of our comment.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,380
So let's take a look at it in action.

21
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,700
And then you'll see what I mean.

22
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,600
So first of all, let's use a text symbol
we've already created.

23
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,890
Now I'm gonna choose text, you'll put it
there as text, zero, zero, one.

24
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:50,040
And save, and I'm just gonna double click
the text element,

25
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,240
just to make sure it does exist, here we
go.

26
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,240
It's called, well, it actually has a value
of surname.

27
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,353
So we should get the word surname up here,
40 characters in.

28
00:02:02,353 --> 00:02:09,576
[NOISE] Let's activate and test.

29
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,119
And there you can see, the surname.

30
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:20,212
Now to make it a little easier to see on
the screen,

31
00:02:20,212 --> 00:02:26,393
let's move this two lines skip down.

32
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:28,985
[SOUND] There we go.

33
00:02:28,985 --> 00:02:34,824
You can see it's directly underneath our
underline.

34
00:02:34,824 --> 00:02:36,250
Now let's change this around.

35
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,510
And we'll copy it.

36
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,950
And instead of using text dash zero zero
one,

37
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,798
what we will do is just specify a brand
new variable name.

38
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:55,520
Don't forget, I've said we don't declare
this variable ourselves with

39
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,090
the data statement.

40
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:02,100
Just by us using this statement with a
specific length,

41
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,550
the system created it for us.

42
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,260
So here, let's specify comments 1.

43
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:08,990
Just comm1.

44
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,570
So now you'll probably think, well, what
does it contain?

45
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,020
Well at the moment it contains absolutely
nothing.

46
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,260
So what we have to do is,

47
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,320
when our program has first started, we
have to fill comm1 with some data.

48
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,560
And if we go down and

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,070
have a look at the initialization section,
that's where we can put this code.

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,454
So we can say com 1equals.

51
00:03:38,454 --> 00:03:43,957
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:45,559
Hello SAP.

53
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,033
How original.

54
00:03:47,033 --> 00:03:53,232
[LAUGH] So it'll do a check, and activate,
and there you can see,

55
00:03:53,232 --> 00:03:58,194
com 1 gets initialized as soon as the
program starts

56
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:03,180
with the value hello SAP, and then we can
output it.
