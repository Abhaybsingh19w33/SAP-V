[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:02,045 --> 00:00:06,001
Now if you've used SAP systems for any
length of time,

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:08,670
you will be familiar with variants.

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,410
Now for those that haven't used variants,
it's really simple.

5
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:18,030
I'm just gonna run our program again and
just show you our screen.

6
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:23,720
Now, when we fill in values, so we can
fill in,

7
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,240
any values we want, let's just say this
one,

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,920
we have the option of saving all the
entries we make in this screen.

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,800
And the object that we save, we call a
variant.

10
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:46,440
So once you make your selections and click
the save button,

11
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,450
this allows you to save a variant.

12
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:49,250
Now, just click save.

13
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,680
Oops, give it a name, Z1.

14
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,810
Oops, oops.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,980
I'll need to give it a description.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,490
That's it.

17
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:02,240
Now all of that has been saved.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,950
So what that allows us to do is next time
when we come back to our program,

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:12,300
when we have a default screen we now have
this button up here.

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,620
Get variance we can click that, select the
variant we want,

21
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,220
and then it will populate the screen for
us.

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,520
And that's it that's what a variant is,
now what we've just done there

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,960
is what a user normally does.

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,860
They would make their screen entries, then
click the save button and

25
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,510
save the variant.

26
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:37,330
But I want to show you some other ways of
creating variants and

27
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:41,790
go through some of the specific properties
of variants that can be useful for

28
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,970
us when creating programs.

29
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,990
So, first of all, back at the se38 screen
We have the variance button.

30
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,590
And if we choose create, we can enter a
brand new variant name.

31
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:59,560
Choose the create button.

32
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,100
He shows us our screen.

33
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,519
We can make our entries.

34
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,080
Give it a description.

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,580
Click save.

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,775
And we're done.
We have another variant.

37
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:21,445
And if I do a drop down, you can see
there's the first and

38
00:02:21,445 --> 00:02:22,785
the second one we've just created.

39
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,855
Let me step back.

40
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:30,275
Now what I suggest is when you're creating
your program,

41
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,355
you create your variants this way.

42
00:02:33,355 --> 00:02:36,415
It's just cleaner and if we go in,

43
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:40,135
we have this additional screen where we
can work with the variant.

44
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:47,370
Now what I'm gonna do, is select one, and
then we're gonna choose change.

45
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,560
These are the values, let's step back, we
got attributes as well.

46
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,655
Attributes take you into this second
screen.

47
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:01,215
If you go to the values then do change,

48
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:05,335
you then have the option of clicking the
variants attributes button from there.

49
00:03:08,715 --> 00:03:10,885
Now let's work our way down this screen
and

50
00:03:10,885 --> 00:03:13,670
have a look at the different attributes,
of the variant.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,760
Well first of all, we have only for
background processing and when we create

52
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,950
ABAP programs, quite often these programs,
they might not be report programs.

53
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,120
They might just be batch jobs.

54
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,260
And we really only want to run them in the
background.

55
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,140
Maybe we only want to trigger them in the
early hours of the morning,

56
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,790
to do some batch updates when no one else
is around using they system.

57
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,600
Well, we can save variance for those types
of programs, and

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,940
specify, only allow this variant to be
used

59
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,830
when the program is being run as a batch
job in the background.

60
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:58,660
And when this happens, that means we don't
have to have the program on the screen.

61
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,760
We can schedule the job to run overnight,
by itself, without having to monitor it.

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,078
The next option is protect variant,and
this allows us,

63
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:14,000
as you might guess, to protect the
variant.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,916
It stops other users from being able to
select the variant,

65
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,962
and using it on their reports.

66
00:04:19,962 --> 00:04:24,378
[BLANK_AUDIO]

67
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:27,000
The next option down, only display in
catalog.

68
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,760
Well, this basically makes the variant
inactive.

69
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,560
The variant will exist, but when a user
does an F4 drop down to have

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,360
a look at the list of variants, it won't
show in the list.

71
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,290
Now moving on down, we have this section
in the middle, field attributes.

72
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:55,120
And if we work from left to right, which
means bottom to top, we can see,

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,660
we can protect an individual field that is
displayed on our screen.

74
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,310
We can hide a field, this one, and

75
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,400
we have another hide field, and selection
variable,

76
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,800
save fields without values, switch GPA
off, and required field.

77
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,170
Have a play around with these.

78
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:20,840
I mean, things like your required field,
it will make field mandatory, so

79
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,740
it has to be filled in.

80
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:26,290
You can see we already made Employee
Number mandatory.

81
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,130
So the users can do this themselves with
variance.

82
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,870
Now in case you're wondering, the P and S
down here,

83
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:38,270
P represents Parameter, and S is Select
option.

84
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,790
Now just as a little practice, let's use
some of these.

85
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:49,080
And let's protect a field so that we can't
change the values.

86
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,540
Let's protect date of birth.

87
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:55,836
Oops.
Click Save.

88
00:05:55,836 --> 00:06:00,547
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:00,547 --> 00:06:05,339
Now, when we come back and run our
reports, oops, wrong one.

90
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:14,003
[BLANK_AUDIO]

91
00:06:14,003 --> 00:06:15,360
And we'll choose our variants.

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,820
Oh, it looks as though [LAUGH] I hid the
variant, did I?

93
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,780
Hm.

94
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,380
Z1, change, oh, I did, didn't I?

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:37,570
Let's take that off and that one and that
one.

96
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,640
Click save.

97
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:45,790
And we've still go the, protected data
birth field.

98
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:51,910
Go to our source code, run our program,
and now we can select variant.

99
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,080
Now, see we protected date of birth, it's
grayed out.

100
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,545
We can't make any entries in there.

101
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:04,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

102
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:07,270
If we load another variant, and it opens
it up.

103
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,260
So have a play around with variants.

104
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,760
They're very useful and when you have
large selection screens,

105
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:21,310
you'll find that users create loads of
variants.

106
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,770
So if you've got 30 fields to fill in, or
maybe you got 30 fields on the screen but

107
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:27,230
only need to fill in.

108
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,270
Say six or seven.

109
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,380
Users save variance so that other users
can pick them up and

110
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,050
use them without having to really fully
understand everything on the screen.

111
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,610
Every month they may save a variant that
the rest of the team may use.

112
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,920
So they are all consistent when running
the reports.

113
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,820
By using the different options, the
different attributes of the variance,

114
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,880
they can remove fields to make it look a
lot easier.

115
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,190
They can protect fields.

116
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,210
They can define default values and then
hide the fields, so

117
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,460
that when other users are in the reports,
it doesn't look so complicated.

118
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,480
They're really useful parts of the system.

119
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,550
There are various ways we can start a
report with a variant.

120
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,660
Now, from this SE38 screen, we can see

121
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,230
a with a variant execution button up here,
I think that's shift F6.

122
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,710
Yeah, that's right.

123
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:32,150
So when we click this one, it says choose
a variant.

124
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,740
Green tick.

125
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,190
And it starts it automatically.

126
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,650
But you know, a user won't normally have
access to SE38.

127
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:48,200
This is really only useful for us in a
development environment.

128
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,950
When a user runs a transaction in SAP,

129
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,300
they usually select the transaction from
the SAP menu tree, or

130
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,020
they enter the transaction code, in the
top left hand corner of the screen.

131
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:05,810
Now another way of running a report,

132
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,590
is by the user going to the system menu
and then the services option.

133
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,780
And choosing Reporting from there.

134
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:20,390
So they'll go System, Services and choose
Reporting.

135
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,680
Now this is like a real cut down version
of SE38.

136
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,790
Takes away all the added in functionality.

137
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,660
And just allows them to select the
program.

138
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,800
And then they can choose to execute it
directly or start with a variant.

139
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:41,200
Now most users will run our program
directly and

140
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:47,500
then load a variant up.

141
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,770
Now by using the go to menu as well as our
little variant button,

142
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,050
we can choose the variant option, and we
choose get.

143
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,290
Then that'll display a list of variants
for us to use.

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,500
Once a variant's loaded up, then the user
and you, can just execute the program.
