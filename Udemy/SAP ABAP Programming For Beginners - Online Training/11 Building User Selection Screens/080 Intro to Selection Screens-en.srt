1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:04,830
Our ABAP reports have two types of
screens.

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,490
There are selection screens and list
output screens, and

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,250
we have already used the output window to
produce list output screens.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,010
So now, let's focus on the selection
screens themselves and

5
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:22,990
how we put individual fields on there,
like drop downs,

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:25,060
text boxes, radio buttons and so on.

7
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,630
For the user to enter values themselves.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,630
Now, if you have used SAP at all,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,950
you will know no doubt have used selection
screens already.

10
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,600
And just by looking at this course, you
can see a selection screen right now.

11
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:44,470
In transaction SE38 natural selection
screen that we see

12
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:50,600
has a textbox with a dropdown, has a
button, there's some radio buttons.

13
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,870
So, you know, we're gonna reproduce this
type of thing for our programs.

14
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,420
Everything that we produce will allow the
user to select data

15
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,360
to be used as parameters in our programs.

16
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,663
And when we produce selection screens, we
are actually creating dialogue screens.

17
00:01:07,663 --> 00:01:13,020
But the beauty is we don't have to write
the actual dim pro code ourselves.

18
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,885
All we need to do is use specific ABAP
statements and and

19
00:01:16,885 --> 00:01:20,225
the system will take care of all the
screen flow logic for us.

20
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,405
Now, as already mentioned, list screens
and

21
00:01:24,405 --> 00:01:27,245
selection screens are both dialogue
programs.

22
00:01:28,305 --> 00:01:32,030
Every dialogue program has at least one
dim pro

23
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:34,620
which is held in what's called a module
pool.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,704
Now, a dim pro report program called
Standard Selection Screen,

25
00:01:40,704 --> 00:01:45,900
is called and controlled automatically by
the runtime environment.

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,063
While the program is executed the dim pro
number itself is actually 1,000.

27
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:56,925
The user will only see the screen when the
programmer includes the parameters

28
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:00,160
in their program using specific ABAP
statements.

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,760
And it is these ABAP statements that cause
the screen to be generated

30
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,820
undisplayed to the user.

31
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,610
This means it's really simple for the
programmer to get started

32
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:16,350
writing their own programs without needing
to think about code to control the screen.

33
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:21,520
However, there are a few specific pieces
of information.

34
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,231
You need to understand in order to use
selection screens with your programs.

35
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:28,120
Which is what we are going to cover next.
