1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:07,043
We already have our select option defined,
so let's start some code.

2
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:11,303
[BLANK_AUDIO].

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:16,085
We'll go to the end and all I'm going to
do,

4
00:00:16,085 --> 00:00:20,105
is recreate the select statements.

5
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:24,349
Select star from z employees, so

6
00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:28,450
here, we're creating a loop.

7
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,080
I'll put the n select in.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,340
And now, I'll include an if statement.

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,708
If, for z employee record,

10
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:48,237
date of birth field.

11
00:00:48,237 --> 00:00:50,570
In my DOB.

12
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:58,326
[BLANK_AUDIO].

13
00:00:58,326 --> 00:01:00,502
We will just write out the full record to
the screen.

14
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:09,708
[BLANK_AUDIO].

15
00:01:09,708 --> 00:01:10,701
So now we have this code.

16
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:18,188
Let's just format it correctly,

17
00:01:18,188 --> 00:01:24,650
ended up with our full stock.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:26,330
There we go.
So what this is going to do is

19
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:30,775
select all the records from the employee
file if our date of birth

20
00:01:32,615 --> 00:01:36,665
matches any record from our select option.

21
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:41,930
So don't forget we can have, we could have
20 different Individual records here,

22
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,460
with a mix of single values, a range of
values to include,

23
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:49,730
a range of values to exclude, and

24
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,850
maybe a, a list of individual V\values to
exclude as well.

25
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:02,220
Well just by using this in operator, the
system will take care of the selection for

26
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,320
us, it will do all the work that is
required to only return true if

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,080
the employees date of birth doesn't meet
the criteria set up in the internal table.

28
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:18,260
And we will then write out the record onto
the screen.

29
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:25,190
So let's debug this code and we can see it
step by step and you can see how

30
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,220
the internal table for the select option
for my date of birth, gets filled up.

31
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,825
Now first of all, I'm just gonna comment
out some code.

32
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:42,805
[SOUND] Take this out and we'll take,

33
00:02:42,805 --> 00:02:47,313
take these out as well.

34
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:50,454
Just so we've got our very simple select
option.

35
00:02:50,454 --> 00:02:59,214
[BLANK AUDIO].

36
00:02:59,214 --> 00:03:00,793
I got attack of the typos once again.

37
00:03:00,793 --> 00:03:07,345
[BLANK_AUDIO].

38
00:03:07,345 --> 00:03:07,942
What have I got here?

39
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:12,075
Select start from, oh, look at that.

40
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:18,860
We need the fingers don't seem to be
working quite correct.

41
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,240
There we go.

42
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,390
I'll stick a break point here as well.

43
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,780
Now we'll execute the code.

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,240
So first of all, we get presented with the
select screen, and what I'm gonna do

45
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:38,096
is not enter anything into date of birth,
just so you can see what's presented.

46
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll press F8 to execute.

47
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,200
Now, we come to the break point.

48
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,260
And if I double click my DOB.

49
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,060
We can see, by this icon here, it actually
represents an internal table.

50
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,540
So I'll double click them.

51
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,430
And now, you can see the individual
fields.

52
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,560
And make up this table.

53
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,640
The heart symbol and we will come to
later, that represents a header line.

54
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:17,590
And then, here, we would have the
individual entries.

55
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,410
One for each record that makes a power
select option.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,040
But because we didn't enter anything,
we've got no records here.

57
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,660
So, I'm just going to F5.

58
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,810
We should loop through the table and
output every record.

59
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,490
It shouldn't be too many, five or six.

60
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,170
There we go.

61
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,818
And I'll just make a note of the date of
births here.

62
00:04:43,818 --> 00:04:47,312
So we've got 1969, 77, 58.

63
00:04:47,312 --> 00:04:51,364
So we've ranged from 58 up to 2000.

64
00:04:51,364 --> 00:04:55,042
Just so I know what to use in the
selection criteria.

65
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:56,977
Now, let's run it again.

66
00:04:56,977 --> 00:05:01,025
[BLANK_AUDIO].

67
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:02,958
And, this time, we'll fill in a value.

68
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,880
So let's say, greater than.

69
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,976
Now, I'll tell you what.

70
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,777
F8.
[BLANK_AUDIO].

71
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:13,245
Let me pick a specific date.

72
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:16,983
Let's choose this guy here.

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:21,641
All into one value,

74
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:27,395
of course one two what was

75
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:33,423
the value 021258.

76
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:39,327
F8, now we will look

77
00:05:39,327 --> 00:05:45,891
at date of birth [SOUND].

78
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:48,062
And now you can see we are one record.

79
00:05:48,062 --> 00:05:52,930
The sign has been included, that's the
inclusion.

80
00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:01,560
And we're saying equal to, and there's our
date-of-birth field in the low field.

81
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,750
So now when we step through our code, the
if statement

82
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,536
gets evaluated.

83
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:14,684
We'll go

84
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:20,370
back to fields and show the employee's
DOB.

85
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,540
We can make out individual entries right
here, so this is 18th of November,

86
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,550
1969, and you can see what the 2nd of
December 58.

87
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:32,790
So this shouldn't match.

88
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,310
And it doesn't.

89
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,140
And it skips straight through.

90
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,400
Our next record shouldn't match either.

91
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,520
This one does match

92
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,930
week of the second of December.

93
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:50,790
And as you can see, using this N operator.

94
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,690
A statement has been evaluated as true.

95
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,020
So therefore we will write a record to
this screen.

96
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,040
I just zoomed through, and I guess we will
see one record display on the screen.

97
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,810
And there we go.

98
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,360
Let's run it again.

99
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,730
And we'll include some more options.

100
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,570
So the first thing we did, was that one.

101
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,590
Let's click the multiple selection tool.

102
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:22,300
[SOUND] And you know what, I forgot on the
other values.

103
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,033
[LAUGH] I need to open another session.

104
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:30,392
[BLANK_AUDIO].

105
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:34,338
Let's put this over here, and z employees.

106
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:34,838
[BLANK AUDIO].

107
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,890
There we go.

108
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,479
Now lets just change this a little bit,

109
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:53,975
choose fields now all I want is the data
birth field, with the employee.

110
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:58,080
[BLANK_AUDIO].

111
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,690
That part there.

112
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,630
Shorten this one.

113
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,828
[BLANK_AUDIO].

114
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:03,397
That's all we need.

115
00:08:03,397 --> 00:08:08,940
Now, go to the multiple selection tool.

116
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,295
I will also choose the 13th of December.

117
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:18,777
[SOUND] And then let's exclude,

118
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:25,156
how many dates have we got.

119
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:27,165
58 to 92.

120
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:36,621
Let's exclude [SOUND].

121
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:40,754
First of January, 1999.

122
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:47,731
To the 20th of December 2002.

123
00:08:47,731 --> 00:08:53,518
[BLANK_AUDIO].

124
00:08:53,518 --> 00:08:59,160
Click execute, and just a note, when you
do fill additional entries in,

125
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,622
on the multiple selection screen, the icon
does change.

126
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:07,530
We have this little green square to
indicate we have got multiple selections.

127
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,000
So I will execute and now we will take a
look at the my date of birth table.

128
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,860
That's the first record.

129
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,510
Let's do this.

130
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,130
So now we can see the three entries.

131
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,740
The first one which we saw before.

132
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,870
And the second one and

133
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,080
the multiple selection screen and we can
see it's the same.

134
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,000
It's the inclusion equals to sine.

135
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,930
And then we have a range that we are
excluding.

136
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:44,543
So, you can see we are excluding the first
of January 99.

137
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,150
The 20th of December, 2002.

138
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:55,470
And bt, that equals between, so between
this date, and this date.

139
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:03,870
So now when our if statement gets
evaluated, just this simple, in operator,

140
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:11,610
triggers the system to automatically check
all the records in this internal table.

141
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,790
And if you ask me, I think that's really,
really neat.

142
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,670
Because you just don't have to think about
All the different type of logic,

143
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:22,040
the different permutations you would have
to code for

144
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,320
yourself to be able to check against all
these different types of entries.

145
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,240
You can just say, if our field, in, then
the select option field.

146
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,260
And that's it, all of your logic is done.

147
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:43,360
So F8, and then we get to records return.
