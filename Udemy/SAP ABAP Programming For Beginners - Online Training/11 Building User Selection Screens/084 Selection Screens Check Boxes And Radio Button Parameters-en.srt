1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:07,670
The next thing we're going to look at, is
adding checkboxes to the screen.

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,940
I'm sure you are all familiar with the
checkbox, and

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,090
will agree, it makes data entry for your
users a very simple task.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,330
The checkbox is just another form of a
parameter.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:29,125
And there's a rule that the checkbox
always has to be of data type C,

6
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:31,878
a character with a length of 1.

7
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:36,552
And the content that gets stored in that
parameter, will either be an x, for

8
00:00:36,552 --> 00:00:39,120
when it's checked, or it will be blank.

9
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:42,325
So let's have a look how we defined a
parameter.

10
00:00:42,325 --> 00:00:46,482
[BLANK_AUDIO]

11
00:00:46,482 --> 00:00:50,068
Let's get rid of the surname field.

12
00:00:50,068 --> 00:00:55,989
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,147
And we can add the new field.

14
00:00:59,147 --> 00:00:59,767
Let's see.

15
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:05,215
What was what did we have in our table?

16
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,515
Well, we didn't have one.

17
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:09,753
Let's just define a, a standard field.

18
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:10,613
Oops!

19
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,399
[BLANK_AUDIO]

20
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:15,652
Let's call this my_box1.

21
00:01:15,652 --> 00:01:17,996
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,877
And it's gonna be of type c.

23
00:01:19,877 --> 00:01:22,880
So, you know, we don't have to declare it.

24
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,640
All we have to do, is say the parameter
name, and

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,150
include as, check box.

26
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:36,043
And that is it.

27
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:36,543
Simple.

28
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:45,087
Let's check our code, activate, and then
we can see it on the screen.

29
00:01:45,087 --> 00:01:49,522
Notice how this field is displayed
differently to the other parameter fields.

30
00:01:49,522 --> 00:01:52,013
Yes it's a checkbox, but the label for

31
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:57,720
the checkbox is now on the right hand
side, with the entry field on the left.

32
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,530
But apart from that there's not much
difference.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,020
If we don't enter a value, in other words
we don't click the box, then the my box

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,530
one parameter, the variable will hold a
blank character.

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,944
If we do tick it, it's going to hold a
value of X.

36
00:02:15,944 --> 00:02:20,147
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:23,979
That's as complicated as check boxes get.

38
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:27,290
So now, let's move on and have a look at
radio buttons.

39
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,530
Now radio buttons are another common
method

40
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,940
of controlling the values that get stored
in our fields.

41
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,195
A normal parameter field allows you to
enter any value.

42
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:48,533
A check box parameter allows you to enter
one or two values, an X or a blank.

43
00:02:48,533 --> 00:02:53,524
Now when it comes to radio buttons,
they're very similar to checkboxes,

44
00:02:53,524 --> 00:02:58,216
but checkboxes, they are individual
parameters in their own right.

45
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:02,810
So you can have many checkboxes and select
many checkboxes on the screen.

46
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,460
But radio buttons have to belong to a
group

47
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,500
in which only one radio button can be
selected at any one time.

48
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,972
And the way we define radio buttons, is
very similar to checkboxes.

49
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:19,980
They have to be of data types C, and a
length of 1.

50
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,580
And because they belong to a group, let's
say a group of three radio buttons,

51
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:29,210
we would define three individual parameter
fields.

52
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,778
Let's have a look at an example.

53
00:03:32,778 --> 00:03:36,563
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:40,439
So we'll define the new parameter, but
this time,

55
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:43,621
we structure it a little bit differently.

56
00:03:43,621 --> 00:03:44,810
Let's work with colors.

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:53,310
So let's say we're gonna define a radio
button representing the color green.

58
00:03:55,770 --> 00:04:00,574
So we key in the parameter variable name,
but then we follow it with-

59
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:05,392
[BLANK_AUDIO]

60
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:10,563
Radio button group to define we're making
a group of radio buttons,

61
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:13,066
and then we give the group a name.

62
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:15,086
And let's just call it group 1.

63
00:04:15,086 --> 00:04:17,953
[BLANK_AUDIO]

64
00:04:17,953 --> 00:04:19,870
Then we define our second field.

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:27,891
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:31,271
This time we'll define blue.

67
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,965
Exactly the same thing.

68
00:04:32,965 --> 00:04:33,745
lt's a radio button.

69
00:04:33,745 --> 00:04:34,960
[LAUGH] Look at that.

70
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,834
It's a radio butoon, apparently.

71
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:38,890
There we go.

72
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,897
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:04:42,897 --> 00:04:46,831
And again, this belongs to group 1.

74
00:04:46,831 --> 00:04:47,795
And finally-

75
00:04:47,795 --> 00:04:53,634
[BLANK_AUDIO]

76
00:04:53,634 --> 00:04:55,810
Mister yellow.

77
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,910
Let's line him up as well.

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,844
And again, that's part of group one.

79
00:04:59,844 --> 00:05:01,923
[BLANK_AUDIO]

80
00:05:01,923 --> 00:05:05,611
Now because I'm using the chain command
with the parameter statement,

81
00:05:05,611 --> 00:05:06,950
got to have commas there.

82
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,149
So that's it.
That's how we define a group of radio

83
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:17,380
buttons, where we will limit the user
entry, just to one value in the group.

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,362
So let's check our code.

85
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:23,954
[BLANK_AUDIO]

86
00:05:23,954 --> 00:05:25,355
I do apologize.

87
00:05:25,355 --> 00:05:30,243
[BLANK_AUDIO]

88
00:05:30,243 --> 00:05:33,492
And it looks like I've gone a bit too long
with yellow.

89
00:05:33,492 --> 00:05:36,117
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:05:36,117 --> 00:05:40,494
So, I'm afraid yellow is gonna have to go.

91
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,759
And we'll choose red.

92
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,255
[BLANK_AUDIO]

93
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:47,710
And we'll activate it, and now test.

94
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,010
And as you can see, we have the radio
buttons, and

95
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:56,320
these follow the same conventions as a
normal parameter,

96
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,050
in that we have the label on the left, and

97
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,630
then the entry field, and the radio button
on the right hand side.

98
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,444
And as you can see, by selecting any of
the radio buttons,

99
00:06:11,444 --> 00:06:14,658
we can only ever have one value.

100
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:17,803
[BLANK_AUDIO]

101
00:06:17,803 --> 00:06:21,775
And that just about sums up the parameter
statements.

102
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:25,335
You've seen we can have normal input
boxes,

103
00:06:25,335 --> 00:06:29,085
we can have drop down buttons that define
through the ABAP dictionary.

104
00:06:29,085 --> 00:06:34,237
We can have uppercase, lowercase, we can
check the values,

105
00:06:34,237 --> 00:06:39,985
we can make them mandatory fields by using
the obligatory addition,

106
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:46,150
and also our default values, along with
the checkbox and radio buttons.

107
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,848
It's quite a good selection and that
[UNKNOWN] covers every source scenario you

108
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:57,298
are likely to come across for individual
field entry on the report screen.

109
00:06:57,298 --> 00:07:01,810
Now next up, we're gonna have a look at
something called Select Options.

110
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,301
Now parameters, they can be looked at as
simple screen entry fields,

111
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:11,173
where the SELECT options, let's call them
complex screen option fields,

112
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:15,587
but they're not really complex, but
they're super flexible, and

113
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:18,805
they have a lot of functionality built
into them.

114
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,409
[BLANK_AUDIO]
