1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,590
Let's now step back and have a look at
this parameter statement.

2
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:11,540
Now just by the simple fact that we have
defined a brand new variable

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,220
called my_ee using the parameter
statement,

4
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:20,850
is enough to tell the system we are going
to generate our own selection screen.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,370
And the parameter statement is all we need
to display a field on the screen.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:29,560
Let me just make sure this program works.

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,620
And let's just display this one field on
the screen.

8
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,780
So there you can see, we've got my
employee, and we've got an entry field.

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,620
That's all it took, one statement.

10
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,450
Now let's go through it in a bit more
detail.

11
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:55,480
As I've said, it's very much like the data
statement.

12
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,350
We specify a new variable name.

13
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:02,890
We can make it a type, so we could say
type i for an integer.

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,220
Or just like I've done here, I've used the
like statement.

15
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:14,365
So it picks up the field attributes of the
employee field in

16
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,165
our tables at .employees.

17
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:21,200
Let's add a few more fields just as an
example to show you how this works.

18
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,586
[NOISE] So let's do my

19
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:31,009
[NOISE] put date of birth.

20
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,930
We'll make this like, I think it's DOB is
the field.

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,486
Let's give

22
00:01:42,486 --> 00:01:48,044
it a check.

23
00:01:48,044 --> 00:01:50,417
And there you can see we've got date of
birth field and

24
00:01:50,417 --> 00:01:51,963
it's picking up the parameters.

25
00:01:51,963 --> 00:01:56,260
And it's picking up the field attributes
from the table, and

26
00:01:56,260 --> 00:02:00,650
it even gives us a field drop down box
where we can select a date.

27
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,864
How easy is that?

28
00:02:01,864 --> 00:02:06,618
Then if we want to do an example without
using the like.

29
00:02:06,618 --> 00:02:12,481
Say my number type i for integer.

30
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:16,875
Oops, what have I done?

31
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:20,875
Oh.

32
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:26,338
There's something I need to mention, when
you specify parameters,

33
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:32,340
you are limited to your parameter name
being a maximum of 8 characters.

34
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,773
And I think I just went over here.

35
00:02:33,773 --> 00:02:37,210
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, yeah.

36
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,677
So let's take off that e.

37
00:02:39,677 --> 00:02:45,777
There we go.

38
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:46,920
My number.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:54,460
And one other point is the parameter
statement can use any data type,

40
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,580
just like the data statement.

41
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,580
Apart from floating point numbers,

42
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,130
the floating point data time cannot be
used as a parameter.

43
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:07,366
You will have noticed when we showed the
fields on the screen,

44
00:03:07,366 --> 00:03:16,330
that the screen automatically gives us a
text label here for

45
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:21,350
each field and it just uses our parameter
variable name by default.

46
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,090
And the order in which the fields are
displayed

47
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,440
are determined by how they are defined in
our program.

48
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,297
And, one other thing to see is,

49
00:03:35,297 --> 00:03:39,430
notice how our available names have been
converted to uppercase.

50
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,800
This is the default action.

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,050
So, let's step back and clear some of
these example parameters out.

52
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,320
So we're back just to our employee number.

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,050
And let's take a look at some of the
additions we can use with

54
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,941
the parameter statement.

55
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:06,300
The first one is the default addition.

56
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:09,970
So we could write default.

57
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,220
One, two, three, four, five, six,

58
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,510
seven, eight.

59
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:27,640
And no surprises.

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,150
This is going to default this value Into
the field on the screen

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,970
as you can see here.

62
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:39,100
Now for those of you who are paying
attention,

63
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:43,835
the default statement actually isn't used
with the data statement.

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,128
For the data statement, we use the value
addition but for

65
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:51,415
parameters, we use default.

66
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:56,525
Now the default is only a suggestion.

67
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,080
The user can override the value.

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,980
You know there's nothing saying they have
to use that,

69
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:07,350
it's just a default value that we can
populate on the screen

70
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:11,700
maybe could down the amount of data we
want the user to enter on the screen.

71
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,110
Our next addition

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,297
is by making the field mandatory we can
use the addition obligatory.

73
00:05:21,297 --> 00:05:25,870
So, with this addition, we have the
default and

74
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:30,810
we have the, the default value and then we
would just write, obligatory.

75
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,700
Let's just put these on a new line.

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,540
So it's easy to read.

77
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:50,640
See, you can see, this addition here when

78
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:55,810
executed forces this little tick box to
appear in the blank field.

79
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:05,020
See if I try to run the report, we'd get

80
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:08,710
this message box at the bottom, saying,
Make an entry in all required fields.

81
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:13,730
So we're telling the user you must put an
entry in this field.

82
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,968
It's a very useful addition.

83
00:06:16,968 --> 00:06:22,140
Now, another addition is the value check
addition,

84
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,826
but I just wanna step back and let, let's
have another example of the parameter.

85
00:06:27,826 --> 00:06:35,997
[SOUND].

86
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,039
Now I need to jog my memory, so I'm going
to open up a new session.

87
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,823
Have a look at our table.

88
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:49,281
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:50,303
Okay.
For this,

90
00:06:50,303 --> 00:06:53,304
I'm going to use the ZEMPLOYEES2 table.

91
00:06:53,304 --> 00:07:03,304
[SOUND].

92
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,396
And we're going to look at a field called
gender.

93
00:07:14,396 --> 00:07:16,435
Let's make sure I've got everything
correct.

94
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:20,715
[NOISE].

95
00:07:20,715 --> 00:07:24,952
Now with the gender field, notice when I
click on it, we get the drop down.

96
00:07:24,952 --> 00:07:30,115
And this is because when we created this
table we actually

97
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:34,633
created some individual values that can be
used as

98
00:07:34,633 --> 00:07:39,487
a drop-down list for entering data into
that table.

99
00:07:39,487 --> 00:07:42,995
So when we use this field on a selection
screen,

100
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:47,119
the ABAP dictionary is working away in the
background,

101
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:51,859
helping to ensure any fields that we use
like this automatically

102
00:07:51,859 --> 00:07:56,423
refer to any value help text or foreign
key relationships that

103
00:07:56,423 --> 00:08:01,106
we've all ready set up to help the user to
select valid values.

104
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,000
Pretty cool, huh?

105
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,884
So let's go back and now here,

106
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:15,830
I think if we try and run this program and
put any old value in here.

107
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,097
So normally we would have to select M, F
or U.

108
00:08:19,097 --> 00:08:21,420
Let's say I enter K.

109
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:26,660
We don't get any error message or

110
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:30,460
anything like that to say K is invalid.

111
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:34,160
The only help we get is to say, hey,

112
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,580
we've got some drop down values for you.

113
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,153
But this value check addition [SOUND]

114
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:48,040
allows us to include value checking.

115
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,974
[SOUND] So any entry we make into this
field,

116
00:08:51,974 --> 00:08:56,784
the program will now check that entry
against a valid

117
00:08:56,784 --> 00:09:01,934
value list that we have defined in the
ABAP dictionary.

118
00:09:01,934 --> 00:09:05,693
Enter K, press enter and

119
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:11,779
there you can see, enter a valid value.

120
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:17,560
M, press enter, everything is good.

121
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,075
So that's the value check addition.

122
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,590
And of course you could add it on if we
had some values to check,

123
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,770
just at the end of this parameter as well.

124
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,875
So we have 3 separate additions all in a
row.

125
00:09:37,875 --> 00:09:44,102
[SOUND].

126
00:09:44,102 --> 00:09:45,274
So let's get rid of that for now.

127
00:09:45,274 --> 00:09:49,370
And remove this entry for ZEMPLOYEES2.

128
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:57,270
Okay, the last addition is going to be the
lower case addition.

129
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,560
Remember I mentioned earlier that the
parameter statement

130
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,119
converts everything to uppercase.

131
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,420
We can get around this by using the lower
case addition.

132
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:10,916
So let's define a brand new parameter and

133
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:16,705
we'll be super original.

134
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,245
And use surname.

135
00:10:20,455 --> 00:10:30,105
And make it like zemployees-surname field.

136
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,980
And we're going to add the default value.

137
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,009
[SOUND].

138
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:42,071
for Mr. Blogs, and then we're gonna say
lowercase.

139
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:52,555
[SOUND].

140
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:54,351
To demonstrate how this works and

141
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:58,018
how it's taken effect I'm going to enter
some lowercase letters.

142
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:04,480
And when I press the Enter key, nothing
happens.

143
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,420
We still have the uppercase and we still
have the lowercase letters in the field.

144
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,450
If we didn't have the value check addition
there,

145
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:15,320
these lowercase letters would all be
converted to uppercase.

146
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,660
Let me show you that.

147
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:22,091
[SOUND].

148
00:11:22,091 --> 00:11:23,896
So, we'll take away that addition.

149
00:11:23,896 --> 00:11:26,500
Activate our program.

150
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,250
And now when I put a load of lower case
letters in and press enter.

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,510
It converts them to upper-case.

152
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,420
Let's pop that back in.

153
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:43,540
And that's everything you really need to
know about parameters.

154
