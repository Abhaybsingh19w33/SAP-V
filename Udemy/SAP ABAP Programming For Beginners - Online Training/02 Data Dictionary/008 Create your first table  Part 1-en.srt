1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,730
So here we are with our SAP GUI open and

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,990
the first thing we're going to do is find
a data dictionary in the SAP menu.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:15,679
So open up the tools menu,

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,711
choose the ABAP workbench.

5
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,795
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:27,220
Under Development, you'll then see SC11,
for the ABAP dictionary.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,100
Double click it.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:34,920
And you'll then be presented with the
first screen of the ABAP dictionary.

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,120
So let's go through the different options
that we see on the screen.

10
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,680
The first one we see is Database Tables.

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,610
This is where we can enter an existing
table name,

12
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,860
followed by a display to have a look at
the technical components of the table.

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,110
Then we have views, a view is similar to a
table, but

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,830
all it is, is a table structure, it
doesn't contain any data.

15
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:02,910
Then we have data types.

16
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,046
Data types are what can make up our
database tables, and

17
00:01:07,046 --> 00:01:09,510
we'll have a look at those soon.

18
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,890
We have type groups, domains, search help,
and lock objects.

19
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:21,020
Let's focus on creating a table, first of
all.

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,320
So what we want to do, is click on the
Database Table option.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,960
And in this exercise we're going to focus
on creating a transparent table.

22
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:34,520
There are other types of tables such as
Calista tables and pool tables.

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,570
But you don't need to know about those
just now.

24
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,770
All we want to do is create a transparent
table.

25
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,160
And when we create our table,

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:49,270
we need to ensure our table name adheres
to the customer defined namespace.

27
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:54,850
And this means we need to start our tables
with the letter Zed or the letter Y.

28
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,170
Most commonly, you'll see the letter Zed
being used.

29
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,580
So for our example we're going to create a
table

30
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,980
that will list employees within a company.

31
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:12,128
In the database tables field, enter Zed
employees.

32
00:02:12,128 --> 00:02:15,503
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,128
And click the create button.

34
00:02:17,128 --> 00:02:18,836
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:23,607
This new screen appears and the cursor is
on the short text field,

36
00:02:23,607 --> 00:02:27,878
all we need to do here is enter a
description for our table.

37
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:33,170
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,628
Just type in employees.

39
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:39,920
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,510
Now under the short text you can see
various tabs.

41
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,660
And the one that's highlighted at the
moment is the Delivery Maintenance tab.

42
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,540
For the delivery class, click on the
field, and

43
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:59,790
click the drop down button.

44
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:04,340
This shows you a list of delivery classes
that you can choose for your table.

45
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,970
Have a read through, but the one we want
to choose is Application Table.

46
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,660
Because we're gonna hold master data or

47
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,250
transaction data in the table that we are
creating.

48
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,100
And in the Data Browser/Table View
Maintenance field,

49
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,720
click the drop down again, and choose
Display Maintenance Allowed.

50
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,780
This will allow us later on to enter data
directly into the table.

51
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,270
And before we go any further, click the
save button.

52
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:44,813
[NOISE] Now this window pops up,

53
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:49,711
Create Object Directory Entry.

54
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:54,545
Now what this is all about, is any
development we do within the SAP system,

55
00:03:54,545 --> 00:03:59,000
quite often we do the development in our
development environment and

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,146
we have to move the development through to
our quality assurance environment,

57
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,330
and then through to production.

58
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:12,960
And this window allows us to choose the
development class which has config

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,290
behind it, the actual transport routes
that we want to use for our development.

60
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,080
But in our case, we're just running
through this example scenario,

61
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,040
and we don't want to move our developments
into another system.

62
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,910
So what we need to do is click Local
object.

63
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:35,300
And what will happen is you will see
dollar temp up here as the development

64
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:40,980
class, and that means to the system, this
object is only to exist

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,200
in our development environment and we do
not wish to transport it any further.

66
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,140
So click the Local object button, and we
can see

67
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,840
down at the status bar at the bottom of
the screen, our table is being saved.

68
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,600
And if you go to the Go To menu and choose
Object Directory Entry,

69
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,660
we can then see the Change Object
Directory Entry pop-up box,

70
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,290
which is very similar to the previous one
and

71
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,969
we can see that the development class has
been changed to $temp.
