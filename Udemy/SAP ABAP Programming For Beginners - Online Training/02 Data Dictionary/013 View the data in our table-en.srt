1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,460
So, now we have entered data into our
table,

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:07,845
we'll do the last few steps in this module
and view the data.

3
00:00:07,845 --> 00:00:11,665
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:11,665 --> 00:00:13,163
So, let's press the back key.

5
00:00:13,163 --> 00:00:16,865
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:21,170
We're back to the database table creation
screen.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,280
And to view our data it's very simple.

8
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,163
We'll go back to the Utilities menu,

9
00:00:28,163 --> 00:00:33,670
to the Table contents and choose Display.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:39,050
Now whenever we view a table through SE 11
or SE 16,

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,340
SAP automatically generates a selection
screen for us.

12
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:47,480
So if we don't want to view all the
records initially,

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,870
we can enter some filter values so

14
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,310
that the system will only show us the
records that we want to focus on.

15
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,310
Now in our case, we only entered five
records.

16
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,250
So there's no need to do that.

17
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,230
But what you can do, if we did,

18
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,820
is let's say we want to focus on one
specific employee number,

19
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,830
you can key it directly into here, or key
arrange the start and the end.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,670
All we want to do is view all the records.

21
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,590
So just click the Execute button or press
F8.

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,300
And there you can see all five records
that we entered.

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,820
If we had many more fields on the table,

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,710
the screen would scroll to the right hand
side.

25
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,470
Which means you wouldn't be able to see
all the fields on the screen at the same

26
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:42,470
time, but one thing you can do is either
double click on the field

27
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,900
and the screen will change to just focus
on that one record.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:54,190
Alternatively, if you click the little
check marks

29
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,460
here we'll select three records.

30
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,670
You can then press the Choose button,
which is F2, and

31
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,460
the system will then allow you to cycle
through the three records that you chose.

32
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,230
So you see now, we've got this little Next
Entry button that's appeared.

33
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,240
So if I click it, we go in to the second
record and

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,260
we can see a back and a forward.

35
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,500
We click it again, hopefully it will show
the fourth record we entered.

36
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,020
And there we go, the fourth one.

37
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:35,000
Press back and back again to go to the
start.

38
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,890
And to go back to the default view, the
grid where it shows all our records

39
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:44,050
just press the back key and we're back to
where we started.

40
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:48,300
Have a play around with the screen because
you'll notice that,

41
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,700
all the buttons that appear on the toolbar
that will allow you to filter and

42
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,700
sort the records however you wish.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,250
So as an example, if we wanted to sort
this

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,600
data in let's say alphabetical on
forename.

45
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,000
Just click on the Forename field and then
click the Sort ascending button.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,320
Now you can see it's reordered records for
us.

47
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:25,740
There are lots of things you can do with
this table view, and you'll find that

48
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:31,110
over time, it becomes a real useful tool,
when you want to check on the data

49
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:35,650
within an SAP system, without going to the
actual transaction screens themselves.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,740
So that's it for this module.

51
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,800
You've created a table from scratch,
you've added fields.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,050
And with the fields you've added data
elements and data domains.

53
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,020
You've defined specific field labels for
each field.

54
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:56,970
You've ensured you've generated a key for
your table and configured the necessary

55
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,940
technical elements to ensure it can be
saved in the back end data base.

56
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,190
After that, you entered some data and now
you're viewing the results.
