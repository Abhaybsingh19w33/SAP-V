1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:06,590
So the next thing we want to do is start
entering the field names for our table.

2
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,760
There are a few guidelines that we need to
keep in mind

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,780
when creating fields within our table.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,770
Firstly, our field names can start with
any letter at all.

5
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:25,720
They do not have to begin with a Z or a Y
like our table names themselves.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,960
The field names can have a maximum of 16
characters.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,190
And our tables must have at least one key
field.

8
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:38,670
This is used later on for searching and
sorting of data, and

9
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,870
they identify each record as being a
unique record.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,380
You can assign an initial value to a
field.

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,040
Let's say in our example we had an
employee class.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,950
I say the majority of our employees are
going to be regular staff,

13
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,990
so let's say we have an initial value of S
for staff, but

14
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,610
we do have some employees that are
directors.

15
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,090
Maybe they have a code of D.

16
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:13,640
So we can say our initial value would
always be an S but

17
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,340
allow the user to change the value to a D
later on.

18
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:24,000
Every field that we use in our table is
made up of what we call a data element.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,560
And the data element defines specific
attributes of each field.

20
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,410
One word of warning here,

21
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:35,800
data elements must adhere to the customer
namespace again.

22
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,628
So they must, for anything new that we
create, begin with the letter Z or Y.

23
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:45,113
So let's start off with entering our first
field, and

24
00:01:45,113 --> 00:01:50,890
the field we're going to create is a very
important field within an SAP system.

25
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:57,390
It's the field that identifies the client
that our records are associated with.

26
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,380
So in the field name enter client.

27
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:09,435
In the data element we will enter
M-A-N-D-T.

28
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,720
Now the data element already exists in the
system.

29
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:18,790
And when I press enter after entering it
you can see

30
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,060
the system automatically filled in the
data type, the length,

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:28,450
number of decimals, short text for the
actual data element itself.

32
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,670
Now, very important,

33
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,190
we need to ensure that the client field is
made a key field within our table.

34
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,230
The next field we're going to enter is
going to be our own created field.

35
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:48,400
And this is going to be employee.

36
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,282
Again we're going to make this field a key
field,

37
00:02:58,282 --> 00:03:03,114
and we're going to use a brand new data

38
00:03:03,114 --> 00:03:07,795
element called Z-E-E-N-U-M.

39
00:03:07,795 --> 00:03:10,000
Once you have done this, click the Save
button.

40
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,080
I always like to save the table as we go
along.

41
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:21,210
Now the next thing is Z-E-E-N-U-M does not
exist.

42
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,790
So we have to create the data elements.

43
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:27,560
So even though it's letters, enter it
here.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,790
If we try to activate the table or

45
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,330
just check the table, we should see an
error message and we do.

46
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,260
So basically because we haven't got a data
element

47
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,218
called Z-E-E-N-U-M already existing in the
system,

48
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:48,730
it's telling us we cannot activate this
table and use it within our system.

49
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:53,550
So press F3 or the back button.

50
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:00,130
And then we're going to use forward
navigation to create the data element.

51
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,670
Another way of doing it is to open up a
brand new session.

52
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:07,960
[BLANK_AUDIO]

53
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,670
Go to SE 11 again,

54
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,711
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,100
And start creating the individual objects
this way.

56
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,128
But we don't want to do that, we want to
use forward navigation.

57
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:23,670
And we do this just by double clicking our
brand new data element.

58
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,880
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:30,911
So we get this window that appears called
create data elements and

60
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:37,045
it's telling us the element does not exist
do we want to create it, answer yes.

61
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:40,647
Then we get taken to the Maintain Element
Window,

62
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:45,380
similar to the first screen that we saw
when we created our table.

63
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,498
The Data Element window is asking us for

64
00:04:51,498 --> 00:04:56,862
some short text, so let's enter in here,

65
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:00,003
Employee Data Element.

66
00:05:00,003 --> 00:05:03,212
Now under the short text you can see four
tabs.

67
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:05,870
And the one that's highlighted says Data
Type.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,120
We can see here the Elementary Data Type,
called the domain,

69
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,960
needs to be defined for our data element.

70
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,250
Now this is important.

71
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,960
Domains must adhere to the customer name
space.

72
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,670
Now we're going to create a brand new
domain using

73
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,970
the same name the we use for the data
element.

74
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,030
Now don't get confused.

75
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:38,220
This doesn't mean there's some sort of
magical relationship between

76
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,540
the names, there isn't.

77
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,816
We're just using the same name because,
that's what I've decided [LAUGH].

78
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:47,943
So enter Z-E-E-N-U-M.

79
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,570
And once again we're going to use forward
navigation to create the domain.

80
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:56,110
So double click the entry.

81
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:01,580
It's telling us our data element has
changed and

82
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,088
do we want to save it before creating our
domain.

83
00:06:04,088 --> 00:06:05,378
Choose yes.

84
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:07,711
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:06:07,711 --> 00:06:12,128
We get the create object directory entry
window appearing again.

86
00:06:12,128 --> 00:06:13,634
And just as before,

87
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:19,490
we want to save this development to the
door temp development class.

88
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:21,590
So you can either just click the save
button,

89
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,420
or just click the local object button.

90
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:26,128
[BLANK_AUDIO]

91
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:29,324
So, now because we've used forward
navigation,

92
00:06:29,324 --> 00:06:34,720
it's telling us that the new domain we are
trying to create does not exist.

93
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,520
Choose yes to create the domain.

94
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,127
And once again,

95
00:06:41,127 --> 00:06:45,378
enter some short text that describes what
the domain is going to be used for.

96
00:06:45,378 --> 00:06:54,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

97
00:06:54,336 --> 00:06:58,378
So we will just enter employee domain.

98
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:01,537
Under the short text, we can see three
tabs and

99
00:07:01,537 --> 00:07:05,680
the one that's highlighted says
definitions.

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,600
The fields available to us, the first one
says data type.

101
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,570
Click the drop down on data type.

102
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:19,890
You will see lots of generic data types
already exist within the ABAP dictionary

103
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,950
and we can use one of these for our
employee field or domain.

104
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:33,670
We're going to choose NUMC, which is a
character string with only digits.

105
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,260
So double click the entry and that fills
in the data type field for us.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,390
In the number of characters, enter eight
which

107
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,150
means this field is going to contain a
maximum of eight characters.

108
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:55,840
And we want zeros for decimals, which is
the default anyway for a NUMC field.

109
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,310
Select an output length of eight.

110
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,350
And just hit the enter key.

111
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,500
We can see here that where we have entered
the NUMC, it

112
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,360
has brought back the description of this
field, which tells us it's a valid entry.

113
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:20,220
And the next thing we want to do is take a
quick peek at the value range tab.

114
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,890
Now this tab is all about setting a valid
value ranges for

115
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,570
the domain that you are creating.

116
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,860
If you set a value range and

117
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,060
a user enters a value in a field outside
the valued value range that you set up,

118
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,310
they will be shown an error message and be
requested to enter a valid entry.

119
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,820
Now there are three options for the value
range.

120
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,510
The first we can see says Single Values.

121
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,530
And this is where you actually enter a
list

122
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,290
of individual valid values that a user can
enter.

123
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:06,730
The next is intervals, so if you have
quite a lot of values, but they

124
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,760
are all related or all in a sequence, you
can enter the lower limit and upper limit.

125
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,250
For example, a lower limit of one, an
upper limit of nine,

126
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,480
and that saves you entering nine
individual single values.

127
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:26,550
The user can only enter a value that falls
within the ranges that you specify.

128
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,040
The last option you have is value table.

129
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,150
When you have a large number of possible
entries, it's quite common to use a value

130
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,180
table instead of a value range or list of
single values.

131
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,110
With a value table you specify a complete
valid value table entry list.

132
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,320
But please note that if you use this
option,

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,120
you must also introduce foreign keys to
your table to ensure the users

134
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,390
entries are tested against the value
stored in the value table that you create.

135
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:06,820
We don't need to enter any value ranges
for this domain, so

136
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,870
we all need to do is click the save
button.

137
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:17,090
Once again we are presented with the
object data entry pop-up box and

138
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:22,550
we want to assign this object as a local
object, so click the local object button.

139
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,250
Now the next thing we want to do is
activate this object.

140
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:30,340
Even though we have saved it,

141
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:35,500
it doesn't mean we can actively use it
within our table yet.

142
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,900
We need to set the object as active,

143
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:44,410
which means our other data elements can
actually use this domain going forward.

144
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:49,740
So on the toolbar, you'll see a little
matchstick icon.

145
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,340
You hover over, it says activate.

146
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,780
And you can also press the Control and F3
key.

147
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:02,920
Click the activate button and then you're
presented with a pop-up box

148
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,310
which lists three different objects that
are currently inactive.

149
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:12,940
You can if you wish try and activate all
the objects together.

150
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,760
But I strongly advise you do not do this.

151
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,550
When you are working in a typical
development environment,

152
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:24,480
you have got a number of other people
creating developments all the time.

153
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,490
And it's quite often you will see their
objects appearing in this list.

154
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:32,330
Or maybe you've got a number of
development projects undergo for

155
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,230
yourself and you could see inactive
objects that you've created

156
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:42,020
yourself in other projects that you don't
want to activate just yet.

157
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:45,390
So for now, we only want to activate the
domain.

158
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,670
So our top entry object type D-O-M-A.

159
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,880
You can see ZEENUM.

160
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,050
It is highlighted at the moment, so what
we need to do is click the green tick.

161
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,200
The system goes away, checks all the
entries we have made for

162
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:09,460
the domain itself, and if everything is
okay, it will then activate the object.

163
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,790
And if you look at the status bar at the
bottom of the screen, everything's okay,

164
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,680
so we can now proceed on with creating our
table.

165
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,090
Now remember, we used forward navigation
for generating our domain.

166
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,240
So what we need to do is step back.

167
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,900
So click the F3 key, and

168
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,250
you are taken back to your data element
maintenance screen.

169
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,396
Now because we have created and activated
our domain,

170
00:12:40,396 --> 00:12:46,524
we can now see the text for our domain has
actually come through and

171
00:12:46,524 --> 00:12:52,670
been placed, assigned the ZEENUM entry
that we entered before.

172
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:57,800
And this has brought back individual
domain properties that we created.

173
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,890
Now the next thing we need to do is define
the field labels.

174
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:09,550
So click on the field labels tab and here
we need to define the short,

175
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:13,450
medium, long and heading field labels for
our data element.

176
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:16,520
Now a little shortcut here.

177
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,570
We've already answered the short text, so
if you highlight that and

178
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,630
use your control-C key to copy the entry
to the clipboard, then you can come

179
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,970
down to each individual field label and
just paste it in one at a time.

180
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,390
Now we can see for

181
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:40,070
the short field name Our Employee Data
Element does not fit into the field label.

182
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:44,200
So then just go ahead and tailor it so it
all makes sense.

183
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:49,940
Now remember, the field labels that we
enter here

184
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:53,100
are going to appear as field labels on our
table.

185
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,270
So we don't actually want it to say data
on it.

186
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:59,650
We just want it to say employee, or
employee number.

187
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,299
So in this case, I'm going to choose

188
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:11,524
employee n, employee number, and

189
00:14:11,524 --> 00:14:17,628
copy that to the remaining Field labels.

190
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:22,468
Now you'll see on the left hand side
there's a length field which I have

191
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:24,253
on purpose not filled in.

192
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:29,463
Cuz once you put the entries in the field
label, and press the Enter key,

193
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:35,378
it will automatically calculate the length
of the entries that you have typed in.

194
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:42,990
Once this is complete, save the data
elements and then activate it.

195
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,940
Again, we get a window showing the
inactive objects.

196
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,860
This time we are only left with two
objects and

197
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,970
remember we only want to activate the
object we are working on right now.

198
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,330
So highlighted, we can see object type
D-T-E-L, which is the data element.

199
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:09,650
So just click the tick button.

200
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,310
And if everything works out okay,

201
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:17,900
the status bar at the bottom of your
screen with show objects activated.

202
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,610
Now again, we used forward navigation from
our table to create our domain.

203
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,800
So what we need to do is press the F3 key,
or press the back button.

204
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:35,200
And we step back to our table maintenance
stream.

205
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,000
And you can see right now, The Employee
field that we were creating.

206
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:48,020
The data element entry that we keyed in
has got the appropriate data type,

207
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,120
length, decimals, and

208
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,420
short text brought back into our group to
indicate everything is working okay.

209
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,120
Now we have just gone through the sequence
of creating a data element and

210
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,840
domain that we then use for our field.

211
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,530
We are going to use the exact same
practice for

212
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:09,890
creating four additional fields.
