1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,430
Now we have created our table it's time to
enter some data.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,290
So to be able to enter

3
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:13,240
data into our table, go to the utilities
menu, go

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,660
down to the table contents option and
select create entries.

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,930
This will now take you to a data entry
screen,

6
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,980
that has automatically been generated for
us.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,450
Now before we enter some data, you'll
notice,

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:37,890
the field names of the actual technical
names of the field that we declared.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,610
For each field, we entered some field
labels.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,580
So I'll show you how to change the look of
the screen so

11
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:46,990
the field labels appear instead of the
technical names.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:53,348
Go to the settings menu and select user
parameters.

13
00:00:53,348 --> 00:01:01,770
Now this option allows you to tailor how
tables look specifically for your user ID.

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,740
Every user can do this.

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:08,070
And what we want to do right here is say
show us the field labels.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:13,100
So click field labels radio button and
click the continue key.

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,280
Now you can see the field labels have come
back just as we define them and

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,940
create in the table.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,880
So now let's enter some records.

20
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:30,000
So the employee number is an eight
character field, and

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,730
we defined it as num c, so it can only be
numeric characters.

22
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,131
So here, I'll enter one lots of zeros and
a one.

23
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:52,131
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:07,500
So I've entered the five fields and I'm
gonna press the enter key.

25
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,640
And just watch what happens to the fields.

26
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,110
Notice the surname, forename and title
field have been changed to upper case.

27
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,060
And the system automatically validated
every field

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,100
to ensure we entered the correct values.

29
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,300
So just click the save button.

30
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,625
Check the status bar at the bottom and

31
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,340
you can see the record has successfully
been saved.

32
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,660
So what we're gonna do now is just click
the reset button and

33
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,270
it'll reset these fields back to their
default values.

34
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,752
And we'll enter our second record.

35
00:02:44,752 --> 00:02:49,373
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:49,373 --> 00:02:56,122
[SOUND] Now this time with date of birth,

37
00:02:56,122 --> 00:03:02,469
I'm not going to enter the periods.

38
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:04,593
I'll just enter the numeric value.

39
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:10,897
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,190
So now when I press the enter key.

41
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:16,360
The system automatically validates all the
fields and

42
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,500
does any conversion that it needs to do.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,860
In this case the date of birth field, it
put the correct formatting for us.

44
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,510
Click the save button.

45
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,438
Let's enter another record.

46
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:37,438
[BLANK_AUDIO]

47
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:46,161
Click the save button.

48
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,040
And two more.

49
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,360
Oops, sorry I didn't press the reset
button.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,498
But nevermind, I'll just overwrite.

51
00:03:59,498 --> 00:04:00,414
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:04:00,414 --> 00:04:10,414
[BLANK_AUDIO]

53
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:19,778
One more.

54
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:29,229
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:36,037
[NOISE] Now, just here, I put this slash
in,

56
00:04:36,037 --> 00:04:41,386
let's see if it gives us an error.

57
00:04:41,386 --> 00:04:42,330
It does.

58
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:44,460
You see it tells us to enter the correct
date format.

59
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,350
[INAUDIBLE] Take that out and press enter.

60
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,790
Eh, doesn't like it.

61
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,250
There we go.

62
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:57,520
It's accepted the data.

63
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,070
I click the save key, and that's it.

64
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,520
We've entered five records.
