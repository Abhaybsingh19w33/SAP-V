1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,280
In this module, we're going to focus
specifically on the data dictionary.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:12,810
Now the data dictionary is the main tool
that we use to look at, understand,

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,770
and enhance the database and database
tables that are used by our SAP system.

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,090
We can view standard tables that are
delivered by SAP using this tool.

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,460
We can create our own tables and

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,600
we can even enhance the existing tables
delivered by SAP with new fields.

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,620
There are many other features involved in
the data dictionary, but

8
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,790
we are going to stick with the basic ones
in this module, so

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,900
we can then build on our knowledge later
on when we are creating our ABAP programs.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,110
So the first thing we're going to do is
create a database table.

11
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:58,750
And this will involve creating fields,
data elements, and domains.

12
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,690
You'll get to learn what each one of these
is and

13
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,910
why they are necessary when building your
tables.

14
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,570
Once we are building the table,

15
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,280
you'll become familiar with the tools to
check your table for errors.

16
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,460
Once your tables are error free, we can
then activate our tables so

17
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,210
that they can be used within the system.

18
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:23,340
We will then have a look at maintaining
the technical settings of the table

19
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,790
that we create that will allow us to enter
data into our table.

20
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:33,890
And lastly, we will take a look at the
data that we have entered using some of

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:39,049
the standard SAP transactions that are
available to us in the SAP system.

22
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,770
Let's move on and start creating our first
table.
