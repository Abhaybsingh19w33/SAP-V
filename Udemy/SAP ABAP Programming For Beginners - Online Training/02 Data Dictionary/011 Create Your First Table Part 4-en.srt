1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:05,240
The last final field that we are going to
create is date of birth.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:10,500
So I am going to key in DOB for the field.

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,170
I will create data element z, DOB.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,020
Use forward navigation to create it.

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:21,265
Save in the table along the way, and
choosing Yes to create data elements.

6
00:00:21,265 --> 00:00:26,042
[SOUND] And the date of

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:31,382
birth data element for

8
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:36,159
the short text, for

9
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,780
the domain once again,

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,885
Enter z DOB.

11
00:00:44,885 --> 00:00:47,490
And use forward navigation to create the
domain.

12
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,500
Choose Yes to save the data element.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,970
Assign it to the local object.

14
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,310
Choose Yes to create the domain.

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,130
Enter some short text.

16
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,575
I will enter Date of birth

17
00:01:02,575 --> 00:01:06,616
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:06,616 --> 00:01:10,900
Now for the data type, date of birth is a
date field.

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,980
So we want to choose the appropriate day
field from the drop down box.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,950
So press the F4 key to bring up the drop
down box and

21
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,675
choose the entry that says DATS.

22
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,640
Now press the Enter key, and you can see
an information box has popped up,

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,650
just to tell us the attributes of the DATS
field have been assigned to this domain.

24
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:40,550
So just click the Continue box, and it's
filled in the number of characters for

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,780
us, and the output length.

26
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,570
Now the output length is different to the
number of characters because it will

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,530
actually insert the back slash to separate
the days, month and years of this field.

28
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,150
So activate the object.

29
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,460
Assign it to the local object development
class.

30
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,071
Ensure your domain is selected, in the
inactive objects window and

31
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:08,080
choose Continue, and

32
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,220
check the status bar to ensure everything
is activated and saved successfully.

33
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,080
Press the F3 key to step back.

34
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,210
And on your data elements field, go to
Field label.

35
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,150
And, we will enter Date of Birth in every
field.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:33,780
But, the whole text, Date of Birth, does
not fit in this short description so,

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,570
I'm just gonna key in DOB.

38
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,260
Press Enter to automatically fill in the
field label length and

39
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,970
activate your data event.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,810
Once the object has been activated and
saved successfully, press

41
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:58,130
the F3 key to step back, and

42
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:03,170
there we can see all our fields have been
entered into our table.

43
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:07,135
All the short text and individual data
element and

44
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:10,560
domain properties have come through onto
our screen.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
So that indicates everything is working
just fine for us.

46
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,730
Now the next thing we want to do is just
click the Save button.

47
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,257
So we can just save our progress up to
now.

48
00:03:20,257 --> 00:03:23,716
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:27,620
Then we're going to move on to maintain
the technical settings for our table.

50
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,720
Now, SAP needs to know a little bit more
information about the table that

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,220
we are creating, before it can create the
back end database tables, itself.

52
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,040
So you can either, now, click on the
Technical Setting button, on the tool bar,

53
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:53,088
I'll go to the Goto menu, and choose the
Technical Settings option,

54
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:59,761
which is Control+Shift+F9.

55
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:05,600
We now need to tell our system what
development class we want to use.

56
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,987
So if you click the drop-down button,

57
00:04:08,987 --> 00:04:11,760
you'll see that we have five options to
choose from.

58
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,560
And if you just read the descriptions,

59
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,700
you'll get a flavor of what this is all
about.

60
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,064
We want to choose the first entry, which
is A-P-P-L-zero.

61
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,908
Which identifies this table as holding
master data in a transparent table.

62
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:35,890
Double-click that entry and

63
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:41,402
then for the Size category field, click
the drop-down again.

64
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,760
And here we are just estimating to the
system itself

65
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,490
how many records we are going to be
holding in this table and

66
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,630
it will use these values to make an
educated guess of

67
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:58,160
how it should actually create the tables
in the underlying database.

68
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,898
We're not gonna be holding a lot of data
in our table, so

69
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:06,301
just choose the first option which is size
category zero.

70
00:05:06,301 --> 00:05:11,770
[BLANK_AUDIO]

71
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,910
Once selected, now we'll move down to the
Buffering options.

72
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:19,570
And, we want to ensure that Buffering not
allowed is selected.

73
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,590
And what this mean is basically, do not
load the table contents into memory for

74
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,460
reading, and this prevents the table from
being read in advance of

75
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,170
us selecting the records in our programs.

76
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:40,860
So you may be thinking it would be more
advantageous to hold the data in memory

77
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,820
for speed efficiency.

78
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:47,530
And you'd be quite correct, but now in
that example we don't actually need that.

79
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,450
If speed was an issue for the development
that you were working on

80
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:54,980
you would most definitely want to be using
Buffering switched on,

81
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,120
which would ensure the data is read into
memory.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,840
So if you have large tables that are being
read very often, but

83
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,525
only being updated infrequently, choose
this option.

84
00:06:06,525 --> 00:06:09,570
That's all we need to fill out on the
screen.

85
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,140
So you can click the Save button, and then
press the back key.

86
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:24,950
Now if all goes well we can activate our
table and move onto to entry and records.

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,140
So click the little match stick icon to
activate your table.

88
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,700
And check the status bar at the bottom to
ensure everything has worked successfully.

89
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,970
In this case, it has.
