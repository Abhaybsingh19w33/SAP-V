1
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,504
Now let's take a look at how we can use a
combination of fields and

2
00:00:05,504 --> 00:00:09,199
tables to be passed into a subroutine at
the same time.

3
00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:12,229
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:18,163
[SOUND] So let's go to the top of our
program.

5
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,518
We'll create another perform statement.

6
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:28,375
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:32,190
We'll call this perform iTab02_multi.

8
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:38,880
And here we can leave the table statement
in with our internal table.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,765
But then we'll add in using, and we can
use as our

10
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:49,364
z_field1 and z_field2.

11
00:00:49,364 --> 00:00:55,331
[SOUND] So you can see this is a
combination of the first two perform

12
00:00:55,331 --> 00:01:02,533
statements all combined into one to allow
us to use a mix of fields and tables.

13
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:04,112
So let's generate this form.

14
00:01:04,112 --> 00:01:08,221
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:12,935
[SOUND] Here we go.

16
00:01:12,935 --> 00:01:14,830
And you can see the form has been defined.

17
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,760
We have the table statement, and then we
have the using statement for the fields.

18
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:28,090
Now as I mentioned before, if you're
manually creating your, perform

19
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:33,430
statements, make sure you get the sequence
of fields correct, that you defined.

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:39,234
So, for example, if we had this, you know,
mixed around,

21
00:01:39,234 --> 00:01:43,950
zed field two going to, zed field two then
zed field one.

22
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,670
Things will get mixed up, and we will

23
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,000
be putting zed field two into this local
variable, and zed field one into this one.

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,740
So you can see how it could create some
confusion.

25
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,211
So just keep an eye out on that.

26
00:01:59,211 --> 00:02:01,859
