1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,660
One of the great benefits of using
subroutines is that it helps us

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,600
modularize our program code inside our
actual program.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,670
It helps give our program structure.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,110
So what we're gonna do right now is have a
look at how we can create

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:18,900
these subroutines.

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,090
Now there are a few methods but what I'm
going to show you

7
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:27,370
is by far the easiest and that's using
forward navigation.

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,480
And what we're going to do is

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:38,660
pop this one select statement into a sub
routine all by itself.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:46,395
So I'm just going to copy it to the
clipboard, and I'll comment it out just so

11
00:00:46,395 --> 00:00:51,954
we don't lose it, and then I'm going to
use a statement called perform.

12
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:55,553
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:00:55,553 --> 00:01:00,034
Now, the perform statement is what is used
to perform a sub-routine.

14
00:01:00,034 --> 00:01:04,530
And all I need to do in its simplest form
is say perform and

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,120
then create a subroutine name.

16
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,424
You just make one up that represents the
type of function we want to do.

17
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:16,676
So, in this case, we're going to fill
itab02 with some data,

18
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:22,404
so i say itab underscore 02, actually
there is no underscore there,

19
00:01:22,404 --> 00:01:26,815
itab02 underscore fill, full stop and
that's it.

20
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:30,599
Now, of course all we've done is type in
the code,

21
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:35,360
we haven't created it yet, so we'll use
forward navigation.

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,870
So I will double click.

23
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,770
And it says the sub-routine does not
exist, do you want to create it?

24
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:44,460
I'll chose yes.

25
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:50,290
And then it gives us an option of saying,
well where do you want to create it?

26
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,920
Now, we have the option of, we could
include it in the include that we created

27
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,430
but, you know, the include, maybe we just
want to keep that for data definition.

28
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,496
So, we won't choose that one.

29
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,510
He gives us the choice of creating a brand
new include.

30
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,490
And it's given it its own name which we
can change.

31
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,730
But I don't want to do that.

32
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,310
All I want to do is create this include in
the main body of our program.

33
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,754
So I'm gonna choose this one.

34
00:02:22,754 --> 00:02:24,693
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:24,693 --> 00:02:26,516
[SOUND] Click the middle button.

36
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:28,920
And then what the system does,

37
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,830
it scrolls right to the bottom of the
screen and creates a form.

38
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:37,510
It gives us some comments here.

39
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,880
Then it allows us to enter whatever code
we want, inside the form.

40
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,685
So what we will do is because we have our
code copied to the clipboard,

41
00:02:47,685 --> 00:02:49,440
I will just paste it in.

42
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,578
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:51,578 --> 00:02:52,599
And that's it.

44
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:57,009
This code now belongs in its own
subrooting that we've included at

45
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:58,830
the bottom of our program.

46
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,055
So let's do a syntax check.

47
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:05,339
[SOUND] Everything is good and we can
activate.

48
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,498
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:07,498 --> 00:03:13,743
[SOUND] So, now, it's active and we know,
everything is good.

50
00:03:13,743 --> 00:03:15,741
Let's just review it one more time.

51
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:19,222
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:19,222 --> 00:03:23,717
We created a performance statement and
we're saying, perform this sub-routing.

53
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:26,290
Now, use forward navigation to jump to it.

54
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:32,041
[SOUND] And then the subroutine says,
select all the records

55
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:38,838
from that employee into the corresponding
fields of Table itab02.

56
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:45,454
So, the system will perform any code we
put inside the form endform structure,

57
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:51,677
and then once the system encounters the
endform statement processing will

58
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:57,820
be returned to the next statement under
our original perform statement.

59
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:02,646
So the next statement will be this loop
statement.

60
00:04:02,646 --> 00:04:04,942
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:04:04,942 --> 00:04:08,813
Processing will continue down to the
bottom of the report, but

62
00:04:08,813 --> 00:04:10,063
it will terminate.

63
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:15,950
And please note, I'm considering this the
bottom of the report.

64
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,210
This is a sub-routine.

65
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:21,470
The system will not run through and
perform this at the end.

66
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,031
It knows this is a sub-routine and

67
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:28,430
[UNKNOWN] as being part of the program at
the very bottom.

68
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:31,076
It's a separate sub-routine in its own
right.

69
00:04:31,076 --> 00:04:31,576
