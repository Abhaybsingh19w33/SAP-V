1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:07,640
Function modules make up a major part of
an SAP system.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:14,300
Because for years SAP have modularized
their code using function modules to allow

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,790
for code reuse, both by themselves, their
own developers, and by their customers.

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:27,270
Now function modules are just specific
procedures that defined

5
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:32,240
within function groups and can be called
from any other ABAP program.

6
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,730
The function group acts like a container
for

7
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,960
all the function modules that logically
belong together.

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:46,670
For example, take all the function modules
for your HR payroll system.

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,670
Group them together into a function group.

10
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,400
Maybe there's a bunch of function modules
dealing with cost center reporting.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,800
Well they can also be grouped together in
function module groups.

12
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,390
SAP systems literally have thousands upon
thousands of function modules

13
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,470
that are available for you to use in your
programs.

14
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,890
So there is no need to re-invent the wheel
all the time,

15
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:14,650
have a search around your SAP system.

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,070
To see if function modules already exist,
I've performed a function

17
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,750
you need in your program before having to
create it yourself.

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,460
Let's concentrate on how we can create
function groups and function modules.

19
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,770
And to do this, we're going to take a look
at the function build up.

20
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,220
So I'm going to step out of the ABAP
editor,

21
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,750
[SOUND] and go back to the main menu is
SAP.

22
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:48,749
Now way at the start this course,

23
00:01:48,749 --> 00:01:54,536
I mentioned that the function builder can
be found under tools,

24
00:01:54,536 --> 00:01:59,910
ABAP workbench, developments, and you'll
see it here.

25
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,060
Once you get used to the transactions,

26
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,760
you'll also be able to call it up using
transaction SE37.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:09,937
[SOUND] For our example exercise we're
going to

28
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:16,185
write a program that uses an existing
function module.

29
00:02:16,185 --> 00:02:20,739
But before we get onto that, we'll take a
look at the function module we're

30
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:23,670
going to use and explain how it's put
together.

31
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:28,450
Which will then allow us to discuss how we
can use it in our program.
