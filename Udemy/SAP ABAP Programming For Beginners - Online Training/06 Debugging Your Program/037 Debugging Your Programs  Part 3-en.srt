1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,080
So, let's get back to our debugging
session again the next option

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:14,005
you see is the display list option and
that's Control+F12.

3
00:00:14,005 --> 00:00:19,515
If we press this button, you can see it
takes us to the output screen

4
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:22,455
as it currently stands within our debug
session.

5
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,725
So at the moment we have executed the code

6
00:00:26,725 --> 00:00:30,105
to output the results of the first select
statements in our program.

7
00:00:31,275 --> 00:00:33,615
We can press the F3 key to go back to the
code.

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,335
And if we start to execute some more
lines, and press it again,

9
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:44,045
[SOUND] we can see it outputs another two
lines.

10
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,722
So it allows you to go see the results of
your reports whilst the program is in

11
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:49,400
midflow.

12
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,670
And the last option we've got is
watchpoint.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:57,240
And we will come to watchpoint just in a
little while.

14
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,580
Now the fields mode of our app debugger
allows us to check and

15
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,340
modify the contents of the fields as we're
debugging our program.

16
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,240
You can double click on the field itself
in the code section of the screen, or

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,660
type in the field name in the lower
section of the screen.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,380
So for example,

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,330
if I navigate to a place in the code where
we're dealing with individual fields.

20
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,863
I can double click on the field, and

21
00:01:28,863 --> 00:01:34,856
you can see it's copied the contents down
to the lowest section off the screen and

22
00:01:34,856 --> 00:01:40,086
it shows the actual field name with the
field content alternatively.

23
00:01:40,086 --> 00:01:43,420
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,621
I can type the name or in my case because
I don't like pressing too many

25
00:01:48,621 --> 00:01:54,020
keys I'll copy and paste the name into the
lower section of the screen.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,780
And press Enter.

27
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,400
You can see it has exactly the same
effect.

28
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:06,090
And just to note, because I'm dealing with
a table here,

29
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:11,900
I have to qualify the field name with the
table name first.

30
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,540
So it's table name dash field name
whichever method you choose,

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,800
the field name will always be on the
left-hand side of this grid,

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,880
and the contents will be displayed on the
right-hand side.

33
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,290
And this allows you to continue debugging
your program, and watching

34
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:34,910
the contents of the field that you have
specified in the field names list.

35
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,820
So if I do a single step, we're going
through our code line by line, and

36
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,520
then the next select statement, we should
see a change of surname and forename.

37
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,400
There we go.

38
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,150
So now it's changed to Brenda Nichols.

39
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,620
I'll do it again.

40
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,520
Execute the select and there we have a new
employee coming in.

41
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,030
You'll notice there are only four rows
available here but

42
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:08,760
you can actually monitor below that
amount.

43
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,320
You can use this button to go down line by
line.

44
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:18,350
Or, you can use the Next Page button to
see fields five to eight.

45
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,180
And, quite often, when you're debugging a
program,

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,730
you'll want to manually change the
contents of a field.

47
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,410
And, you can do this by clicking on the
field in question, in this case surname.

48
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,390
Typing in your new value, and then click
this change button.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,240
Now the contents of the surname field have
been changed to Johnson.

50
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,090
This is very useful when you're debugging
your program

51
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,330
because it saves you a lot of time.

52
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:53,980
Quite often you don't want to come out of
your debugging session,

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,280
enter some new values in a variable, go
back into your debugging session again,

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,160
and pick up where you left off.

55
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,540
This function allows you to change the
contents of the field so, you can

56
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,587
dynamically check the logic within your
program using whatever values you like.

57
00:04:11,587 --> 00:04:13,749
