1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,740
Now you'll also see at the bottom of the
screen.

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:07,129
We have three fields, SY-SUBRC,

3
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:12,018
SY-TAPIX, and SY-DBCNT.

4
00:00:12,018 --> 00:00:16,430
And you'll note that the actual value
boxes are gray down.

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,480
Which means we can't change the values of
these fields ourself.

6
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:27,750
These fields are system fields, and
actually belong to a table called S-Y-S-T.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,390
This system table actually contains a
whole lot more system

8
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,350
fields that get filled in at runtime.

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,440
These system fields are updated
automatically

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,000
while your program is executing.

11
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,790
Most statements within ABAP cause the
system fields to be filled with zero

12
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:49,040
when they are executed successfully.

13
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,620
But it's important to remember that these
fields are completely statement dependant,

14
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:57,190
meaning that they will contain different
values,

15
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,520
depending on which statement is executed.

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:04,480
And we will take a closer look to the
system return codes and

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,530
system variables later on in this ABAP
course.
