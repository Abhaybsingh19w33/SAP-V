1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,380
This brings us to the end of the debugging
module.

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,500
And, before we wrap things up, I just want
to discuss how to stop the debugger.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,890
Now, it may seem fairly simple, but

4
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:14,430
there are two ways you can stop debugging
your program.

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,970
The first way is by pressing the F8 key,
and

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,760
letting your program run all the way
through to the end.

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,260
But, keep in mind, if you have any grey
points or watch points set,

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:31,370
the program execution will most likely
pause, and you'll have to press

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,700
F8 key again, and maybe keep doing it in a
cycle until the program finishes.

10
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,710
And, you need to bear in mind that you are
counting on your

11
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,690
program executing successfully.

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,943
If your program causes any runtime errors,
your debug session will terminate, and

13
00:00:47,943 --> 00:00:52,254
you'll be returned to the SAP menu screen,
which can be just damn annoying.

14
00:00:52,254 --> 00:00:55,712
Because you just want to get back to a
C38.

15
00:00:55,712 --> 00:01:00,432
The alternate way of stopping the
debugger, and my preferred method,

16
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:01,710
Is very simple.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:06,430
Just come to the debugging menu, and chose
restart.

18
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,880
That way, no more program code will be
executed, and

19
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,580
you'll be returned to the SE38 front
screen.
