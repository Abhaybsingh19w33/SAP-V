1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,170
Let's now take a closer look, at the table
mode.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:11,500
Just click the Table button, and you'll
see the screen changes.

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,820
We still have a code section, but then the
lower section,

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,400
has now changed to show an entry for an
Internal Table and then a single row.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,540
We haven't covered Internal Tables yet in
this ABAP course, but for

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,560
now you just need to be aware that, an
Internal Table is just a table or

7
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,570
records that are stored in memory while
the program is running.

8
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,910
The table mode option, allows us to
interrogate the records and

9
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,130
fields of each record of an Internal
Table.

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,860
As we did with the fields mode section,
you can either double

11
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,480
click on an Internal Table that has been
defined in your ABAP code, or you

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,699
can enter the Internal Table Name directly
into the internal table input field.

13
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:04,140
So for example, I can double click on this
Z Employees Table,

14
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:10,550
and we can see the screen changes to show
a Table Name, and

15
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,500
below it the individual fields together
with their contents.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,560
So as you can see it's very similar to the
fields mode.

17
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,860
And that you'll see the Field Name and the
Field Contents.

18
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,690
Table mode allows us to see a whole
Internal Table.

19
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,310
Now in this example, things do look a
little different to normal,

20
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:37,070
because I'm actually dealing with a table
structure right now.

21
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:40,110
We haven't declared an actual Internal
Table itself.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,660
And the program is just using table
structure, which results in a table list

23
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,780
like this, showing the individual fields
listed one to six with their content.

24
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,412
When viewing Internal Tables, you will see
a slightly different layout.

25
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:04,453
Where you'll see, a number of records for
each internal table, with the content,

26
00:02:04,453 --> 00:02:08,713
and then you can double click on those
Records to then show this layout,

27
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:11,844
which shows the individual fields for each
record.

28
00:02:11,844 --> 00:02:14,549
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:18,213
As we move along in this course, we will
be debugging our programs, and

30
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:22,200
looking at proper internal tables, and
you'll see the screen layout then.

31
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,070
As we did with the Field List section, you
can now navigate up and

32
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,240
down the Field List.

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,230
And interrogate the contents of the table
and the individual fields, and

34
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,300
you can continue debugging your program in
table mode,

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,290
and see how your program code changes the
table contents.

36
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:48,080
Now, I don't often do that myself, because
as you'll notice,

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,650
the screen that's your code section, has
become very small.

38
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,190
You only get what one, two, three, three
lines of code that are visible.

39
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,180
So as you step-by-step go through your
code,

40
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,690
you can see, you don't actually get to see
much about code.

41
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,920
Only the couple of lines surrounding the
statement, that it's currently executing.

42
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,760
So more often than not, I'll have a look
at the Table, I'll have a look at

43
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,250
the Contents, find out the information I
want and then switch back to fields mode.

44
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:23,500
[SOUND]
And

45
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,770
you can switch between these different
modes of the debugger, any time you like.
