1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:03,850
Now the Insert statement follows similar
lines.

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,560
Let me bring in the code from the header
record example.

3
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:16,634
Here we used a Describe statement

4
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:21,615
to find out how many records

5
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:26,164
in the internal table and

6
00:00:26,164 --> 00:00:31,794
hold that value in line count,

7
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:38,091
which I will declare again [SOUND].

8
00:00:38,091 --> 00:00:42,544
And it looks like I got the last example
wrong because I specified the work

9
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,789
area incorrectly.

10
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:46,987
That'll teach me to check my code.

11
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:50,190
So back to the insert,

12
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,261
the Describe statement holds the number of

13
00:00:56,261 --> 00:01:01,657
records in the Line Count variable and

14
00:01:01,657 --> 00:01:07,054
the Insert statement would say insert

15
00:01:07,054 --> 00:01:13,459
a record from our work area, into our
table,

16
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:19,890
using the index position held in Line
Count.

17
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,860
So the syntax is a little bit different
from standard where we actually say,

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,530
first of all, insert our work area record
into our table

19
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,730
rather than specifying the table first
like we did with the Modify statement.

20
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,870
The work area is second.

21
00:01:39,485 --> 00:01:47,310
[SOUND] But nonetheless it's still
relatively simple.
