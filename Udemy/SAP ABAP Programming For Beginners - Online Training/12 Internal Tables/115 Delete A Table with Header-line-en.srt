1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:06,690
This next topic is gonna be quite small,
and it's important that you know about it.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,490
And this is Deleting Internal Tables.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,740
First of all with header lines, and then
with work areas.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:19,020
When working with Internal Tables, you
will see that there are many occasions

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,780
when you want to delete all the records of
the Internal Table in one go.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,230
And this obviously depends on the specific
task you are trying to

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,080
complete with your program, and
whereabouts in the program flow you are.

8
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:35,620
As an example, if you were to fill in the
Internal Table

9
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,480
whilst you were inside that higher level
loop, more often than not,

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,800
you will need to make sure your table is
empty at the start of the loop.

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,530
So that when the next iteration of the
loop comes around,

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,920
you are not left with any records from the
previous iteration.

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,610
Now there's a certain sequence of tasks
that you should really adhere to,

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:02,790
when deleting the contents of a table with
a header line.

15
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:06,240
First, you have to make sure you clear out
the header line.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,260
Then make sure you clear out the body of
the Internal Table.

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,570
So, let's have a look at the code and see
exactly how we would do this.

18
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:20,250
So I've loaded in one of the previous
examples, where we fill an Internal Table.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,190
And it's very simple.

20
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,320
There's our Internal Table.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,920
We have a select statement to fill in, and

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,880
a simple write statement to help with
debugging.

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:40,230
So now, once we've used our Internal
Table, we want to clear it out.

24
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:45,230
So first of all, clear out the header
line, and we use the clear statements.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,140
Very simple.

26
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,190
And all we do is say clear, and then the
table name.

27
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,380
And this will clear out the header line
only.

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,100
By specifying the Internal Table after the
clear statement, the header

29
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,900
line will be wiped clean, meaning all
fields will be set to their initial value.

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,560
Then, to deal with the table body that
contains all your records.

31
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,560
We use the clear statement again but this
time,

32
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,640
we used two square brackets at the end of
the table name.

33
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,250
So what we do is this, followed by two
square brackets,

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,700
and this results in all the records from
the body of the table being deleted.

35
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,350
Now there is another way clearing out the
records of a table, and

36
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,542
that's by using the refresh statements.

37
00:02:39,542 --> 00:02:42,180
And the syntax is super simple.

38
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:48,330
All we do is say Refresh and the table
name.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,930
And by using this statement, you delete
all the records in the table,

40
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:59,760
but you still have to keep in mind your
header record still contains values.

41
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,870
It is untouched by the refresh statement.

42
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,890
So, just remember to use the clear
statement that we defined first.

43
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,680
Now before moving on there's actually
another statement and

44
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,900
this one is called the Free Statement.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,480
And as you might guess this syntax is
super simple again,

46
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,690
all we do is type Free.

47
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,990
And then the table name.

48
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:32,100
Now, not only does this statement empty
out the records from the Internal Table,

49
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,370
but, it also frees up the memory being
used by your program.

50
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:39,640
It doesn't mean your Internal Table no
longer exists,

51
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,210
it just means that it's been emptied out
of memory.

52
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:47,740
So if you need to access the Internal
Table again,

53
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,670
maybe to fill it with records, then you
can do so.

54
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,975
It's just that the program when it does
that,

55
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,830
it needs to reserve the memory space
again.

56
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,630
So the free statement does, you know, the
same job

57
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:04,930
as the clear statement with the two square
brackets and the refresh statement.

58
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,050
But, it has the added benefit of emptying
out the memory used from your program,

59
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,750
it clears it out.

60
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,600
So, it releases the memory to be used by
some other process.

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,470
And just like with the other two
statements, the header line is unaffected.

62
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,290
So don't forget to use the clear
statement, to clear your header line.
