00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:05,870
Our next topic is all about sorting
records in our internal table.

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,080
So it's probably not gonna be a shock to
learn that the statement

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,800
we use to sort our data is actually called
sort.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,110
And the basic format is really, really
simple.

5
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,878
Let's have a look.

6
00:00:19,878 --> 00:00:29,003
[BLANK_AUDIO]

7
00:00:29,003 --> 00:00:35,950
Well it consists of a salt and then the
table name.

8
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:40,170
As you can see the syntax is super easy
and in this case,

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,720
because we have got no additions to the
statement, our internal table

10
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:49,250
will be sorted in ascending order based on
the defined table key.

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,950
Now this works for sorted tables and hash
tables.

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,166
If we are using standard tables then you
are required to use the buy addition and

13
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:02,170
that will look like this.

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:07,045
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:07,045 --> 00:01:10,270
We just add the word BY followed by the
fields we want.

16
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,180
In this case, I'm just specifying one
field and by specifying

17
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:20,260
the field name the internal name will be
salted in accordance with the contents.

18
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,500
Now don't forget, SAP caters for all sorts
of languages and

19
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:30,010
we need to take that into account if we're
working on programs for

20
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,200
a company where their systems are used
throughout the world.

21
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:39,820
So to ensure your internal table is sorted
according to language specific criteria.

22
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,370
Use the AS TEXT addition directly after
the name of your internal table.

23
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:55,470
So then we build up the sort statement
just a little bit more by using AS TEXT.

24
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,930
Now our source statement, you know,

25
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:03,300
is just using one field right now but
you're not just limited to one.

26
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,345
You can list up to 250 fields to use in
your source statement.

27
00:02:07,345 --> 00:02:12,190
[LAUGH] I've never seen anywhere close to
that being used but

28
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:18,210
just to show how we can extend it, we can
say sort by surname and then by forename.

29
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:24,930
And note, there's no need for a comma
separator, all we do is a space and

30
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,355
then list our field [UNKNOWN].

31
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:33,620
Now just one extra thing is, we specified
AS TEXT

32
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,630
in our source statement and because of
where we placed it within the statement.

33
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:47,100
This country specific sorting is going to
be applied to all fields that we specify.

34
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,980
If you only want the AS TEXT edition to be
applied to specific fields,

35
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,630
you need to repeat this addition after
every field in your list.

36
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,211
So let's say we just wanted AS TEXT to
apply only to the forename.

37
00:03:06,211 --> 00:03:09,546
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:15,096
We would remove it from this point and
then place it after our forename field.

39
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:20,440
Now let's [UNKNOWN] with the, just

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,155
a one sort of statement we have in our
example and let's discuss the sort order.

41
00:03:25,155 --> 00:03:33,145
Now the default is for our sort statement
to sort our records using ascending order.

42
00:03:33,145 --> 00:03:36,185
But we can if we wish specify ascending or

43
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:38,870
descending within the SORT statement
itself.

44
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,400
And we do this by SORT itab01 and

45
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,800
then this is where we would specify
ascending or descending.

46
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,680
So if we wanted it in reverse order,

47
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,336
[SOUND] we would include the word
descending.

48
00:03:54,336 --> 00:03:56,170
Nice and easy.

49
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,961
And that's about it for the SORT
statement.

50
00:03:57,961 --> 00:04:01,509
