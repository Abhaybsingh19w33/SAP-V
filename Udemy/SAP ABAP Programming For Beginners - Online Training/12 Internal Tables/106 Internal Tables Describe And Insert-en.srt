1
00:00:01,206 --> 00:00:06,635
Let's continue on with this example where
we have modified the table.

2
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:12,637
And, I want to introduce a new statement
called describe table.

3
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:16,423
A describe statement can be used to find
out information about the content

4
00:00:16,423 --> 00:00:17,590
of an internal table.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,784
This includes the number of records the
table holds,

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,855
the reserve memory space used, and the
type of table,

7
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:31,298
if it's a standard table, sorted table, or
a hash table.

8
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:36,051
But in the years I've been using ABAP,
I've only ever seen this statement

9
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:39,982
used to find out how many records exist in
the internal table.

10
00:00:39,982 --> 00:00:42,722
So let's concentrate on that one.

11
00:00:42,722 --> 00:00:46,007
Now the way we do this is very simple.

12
00:00:46,007 --> 00:00:51,654
We just type describe table, which is the
actual statement,

13
00:00:51,654 --> 00:00:57,639
followed by our internal table, which in
this case is itab01.

14
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:00,450
Then we want to know the number of
records.

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,910
So what we do is use the addition of
lines.

16
00:01:05,735 --> 00:01:10,779
Then we have to tell the system how we
want to store this value,

17
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,670
so let's use a new variable called
line_cnt.

18
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,046
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,531
And up here I'll make sure we have a data
statement.

20
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,189
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:26,209
Called line_cnt with a type i.

22
00:01:26,209 --> 00:01:29,577
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:32,578
So, this statement will return an integer
value

24
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:36,895
that represents the number of lines
contained in our internal table,

25
00:01:36,895 --> 00:01:40,350
and the value will be stored in the
variable we defined.

26
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,820
So, why would you want to know this?

27
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,890
Well, we have covered the append statement
in a previous module.

28
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,300
So you should know that the append
statement only adds lines

29
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,030
to the end of a table.

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,590
Now instead of using append, we could use
the insert statement.

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,520
And the insert statement allows us to
insert records into any position

32
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,390
we choose inside an internal table, by
specifying the table index number.

33
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,621
If we wanted to insert a record into an
internal table,

34
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:20,926
record number ten for example, we will
specify index ten,

35
00:02:20,926 --> 00:02:27,633
which would then insert our new record
between the ninth and tenth record.

36
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:31,139
And we would do this, simply like this.

37
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:40,798
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:47,184
We declare the INSERT statement, internal
table, we're going to insert record into.

39
00:02:47,184 --> 00:02:52,156
Then we specify the index number of the
record that we want to insert our

40
00:02:52,156 --> 00:02:53,430
new record into.

41
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:59,170
And this is where we can use our line_cnt
which holds,

42
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,910
in this case, the total number of records
in our table.

43
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,750
Therefore, the result of these two
statements that describe an insert,

44
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,200
in this case,

45
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,220
the system will insert a record before the
last record in the internal table.

46
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:22,649
So like I said, if there's ten records,
line_cnt will hold a value of ten.

47
00:03:22,649 --> 00:03:28,268
The new record is inserted between the
ninth and tenth record, and

48
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:35,210
that's why our new record will be inserted
one record before the end of the table.

49
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:45,210
[BLANK_AUDIO]

50
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,300
Okay, now I've got those [LAUGH] bugs out
of the way.

51
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,480
I'm just going to edit this a little bit,
so this program makes a bit more sense.

52
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:04,735
What I'm going to do is move this loop to
finish here,

53
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:08,842
and once we've gone through every record,

54
00:04:08,842 --> 00:04:13,074
we'll then come on to these two
statements.

55
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:17,648
[BLANK_AUDIO]

56
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:19,060
So I'm gonna set a break point.

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,321
[BLANK_AUDIO]

58
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:27,779
And we'll debug it and see how all this
works.

59
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:30,101
So we've looped through itab.

60
00:04:30,101 --> 00:04:33,758
I'll double-click it and you can see we
have five records still.

61
00:04:33,758 --> 00:04:39,202
[BLANK_AUDIO]

62
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:43,080
And if we have a look at the value of
line_cnt right now, it's 0.

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,100
So we'll execute this row of code.

64
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,597
Now it's telling us we have 5 records.

65
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:55,657
Then we come to the INSERT statement, and
if I flick back to itab01,

66
00:04:55,657 --> 00:05:00,708
we'll just scroll down, so we can see what
happens here.

67
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:07,540
Now remember, our header record has this
value in it, 1, lots of 0s, and 6.

68
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,240
And this is a standard table, so we are
allowed duplicates.

69
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,432
So when the INSERT statement gets
executed,

70
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:21,494
hopefully it's going to insert a line
right here.

71
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:25,352
Now it's gonna be difficult to see because
[LAUGH] the record's

72
00:05:25,352 --> 00:05:27,472
exactly the same as the fifth one.

73
00:05:27,472 --> 00:05:34,786
So what I'm gonna do, is change this
header record.

74
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:39,569
I'm going to change the value of some of
the fields just a little bit, so

75
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:42,530
that you can see the record being
inserted.

76
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,445
So, I'll change employee number.

77
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:48,985
[BLANK_AUDIO]

78
00:05:48,985 --> 00:05:52,862
Oops, to seven.

79
00:05:52,862 --> 00:05:55,405
Oops, I pressed the wrong one, by the
looks of things.

80
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:59,247
[BLANK_AUDIO]

81
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:00,003
There we go.

82
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:03,206
[BLANK_AUDIO]

83
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:04,623
And let's change surname.

84
00:06:04,623 --> 00:06:09,905
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:06:09,905 --> 00:06:14,525
To Stevens.

86
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:15,187
Okay.

87
00:06:15,187 --> 00:06:18,890
Back to the fields.

88
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,270
Have a look at the table.

89
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,745
Go to the top.

90
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:26,535
Now we can see our header record has the
1,

91
00:06:26,535 --> 00:06:31,501
lots of 0s and 7, and the surname is equal
to Stevens.

92
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:37,861
So now we will insert this header record
into the table at position five,

93
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:43,818
which if you remember, is the total number
of records in our table.

94
00:06:43,818 --> 00:06:44,979
So, we'll execute it.

95
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:47,767
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:48,612
Silly me.

97
00:06:48,612 --> 00:06:50,202
I didn't have anything after

98
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:56,716
[BLANK_AUDIO]

99
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:57,795
Let's run it again.

100
00:06:57,795 --> 00:06:58,921
Do apologize for that.

101
00:06:58,921 --> 00:07:01,894
[BLANK_AUDIO]

102
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:06,375
So once again, there's line_cnt.

103
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:09,033
Go one line of code down.

104
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:11,355
It now contains five records.

105
00:07:11,355 --> 00:07:13,678
We'll have a look at itab01.

106
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:21,479
We'll go in and amend the header record
again, choose this one.

107
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,951
So, if I just come down here and

108
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:31,581
say itab01-surname,

109
00:07:31,581 --> 00:07:35,793
itab01-employee.

110
00:07:35,793 --> 00:07:37,512
I'll change that to BLOGS.

111
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:40,890
[COUGH] And this one I'll change to 7.

112
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:45,579
[BLANK_AUDIO]

113
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:47,914
Oops.

114
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:52,372
7, there.

115
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,725
So if we have a look at the internal
table,

116
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:58,373
there's our header record with the new
data we've just added.

117
00:07:58,373 --> 00:08:03,652
Scroll down, and then when it executes the
INSERT statement,

118
00:08:03,652 --> 00:08:07,836
we should have another record inserted
here, and

119
00:08:07,836 --> 00:08:11,839
this record should be moved down one
position.

120
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,102
There we go.

121
00:08:14,102 --> 00:08:15,540
That's the INSERT statement.
