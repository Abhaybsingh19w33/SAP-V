1
00:00:01,780 --> 00:00:06,356
So now we have gone through how to fill,
modify data,

2
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:11,863
delete data from our internal
tables that have a header record.

3
00:00:11,863 --> 00:00:17,001
Let's now swap over and look internal
tables that don't have a header record,

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,684
the ones we want to use going forward, and

5
00:00:19,684 --> 00:00:23,150
they're the ones where we
specify our own work area.

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:28,290
Now we're not gonna go
through every example again.

7
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:30,800
But what we will do,
is go though the differences.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,230
So first up,
let's have a look at reading data.

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,421
When we have a loop statement,

10
00:00:38,421 --> 00:00:41,971
that loops through our internal
table that uses a work area.

11
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:45,470
The loop reads each record
from our internal table,

12
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,580
into the work area instead
of the header line.

13
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:53,270
Now because we have the ability
to specify the work area

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:58,370
completely separate to our internal table,
we must specify

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:03,300
that work area we want to use within
our loop to read the data into.

16
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,920
So let me clean up this code and

17
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,160
have a look at some examples of using
the work area with loops and so on.

18
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,790
I have loaded up the code that we have
used in a previous example when looking at

19
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,790
work areas.

20
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:24,443
And we already specified how to
use a work area in an example but

21
00:01:24,443 --> 00:01:27,330
we did not go into great detail.

22
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:28,090
So let's do that now.

23
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,709
So here is where we add an array fetch.

24
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,520
We're not too bothered
about that right now.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,970
Let's remove it.

26
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:38,510
I'll tell you what,

27
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:42,330
no we'll keep it in because [LAUGH]
that fills out our internal table.

28
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,271
Let's concentrate on this
piece of code right here.

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,667
So as you can see, the standard
loop statement, we're looping our

30
00:01:55,667 --> 00:02:00,642
internal table but we're going to
instead of using the hex line,

31
00:02:00,642 --> 00:02:05,910
we're gonna read our records into
how our own predefined work area.

32
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,700
And then when we want to work with any
data that belongs to the work area,

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,340
we reference the work area directly.

34
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,010
So our write statement says WRITE
the surname field from our work area,

35
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:23,400
not the internal table
