1
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:03,950
Now to modify records,

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,780
the modify statement again has to
reference the work area.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:14,410
So, I'll bring in an example from using
the header record, than we'll modify it,

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,850
to use the work area.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:22,530
So we're using iTab02 in this case.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,510
So if the surname is Jones oops.

7
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,258
Sorry, I need to specify the into.

8
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:33,085
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:33,085 --> 00:00:36,451
So, we would then say

10
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:43,190
if_wa_iTab02surname equals Jones.

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,293
And then we would modify

12
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:55,960
the work area record to say SMITH.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,478
And then the actual modify statement
itself would be MODIFY iTab02,

14
00:01:02,478 --> 00:01:06,176
and then we would say FROM our work area.

15
00:01:06,176 --> 00:01:10,960
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,760
So to summarize, we are telling the system
to modify our Internal Table

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,560
using the record we hold in our work area.
