1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,950
Let's now take a look at the restatements.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:07,850
And as you can probably guess, the
restatement follows a similar logic in

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:12,234
that we must use our work area with our
restatements.

4
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:15,568
And if we go straight to the code, we can
have a look at how we write it.

5
00:00:15,568 --> 00:00:21,990
So we would say READ TABLE and

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:29,791
then we specify the table we want to read,
which is itab02.

7
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,870
We specify the index of the record we want
to read.

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:36,150
But instead of leaving it there with a
full stop, we continue on to say and

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:43,086
store the record into

10
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:48,623
our work area.

11
00:00:48,623 --> 00:00:53,257
[SOUND] Now just like in previous
examples,

12
00:00:53,257 --> 00:01:01,238
quite often you do not know the index
number of the record you want to read,

13
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,503
so you would use the with key addition.

14
00:01:05,503 --> 00:01:10,526
So the way we write that is instead of

15
00:01:10,526 --> 00:01:16,051
using the index again, we do retable,

16
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:23,600
internal table which is itab02 into our
work area.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,628
And we specify with key, and then we
specify the key we want to use.

18
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:37,710
So in our case let's use surname equals
Smith.

19
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,840
So just as before when we specify the work
area we want to read the record into,

20
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,330
the same thing happens here.

21
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:52,280
The record is transferred to our work area
based on our key to

22
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,680
allow us to continue with the rest of our
program.

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,030
Now I mentioned previously, when we were
discussing the read statement.

24
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,760
With internal tables that have headlines.

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,720
You need to keep in mind that tables
without unique keys

26
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,060
can have multiple records.

27
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:14,586
That match the criteria that you specify
with your read statement.

28
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:17,739
