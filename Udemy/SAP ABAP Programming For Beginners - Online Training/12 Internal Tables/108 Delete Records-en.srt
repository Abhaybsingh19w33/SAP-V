1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:07,120
Next, let's take a look at how we can
delete records from our internal table.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,650
And it's really simple, we just use the
delete statement.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,340
And we can use the delete statement to
remove individual records or

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,100
groups of records from our table at any
one time.

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,480
The fastest way of achieving this is by
using the table index.

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,160
Just like we did with the read statement.

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:34,940
But note this only applies to standard
tables and sorted tables not hash tables.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:38,590
Only these two types of tables have an
index.

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,970
So let's have a look at the code.

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,080
So we start off with the word delete,

11
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,390
we specify our internal table, and then we
just give it an index.

12
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,030
It's pretty simple.

13
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,810
We make no use of the header line here.

14
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,440
Instead, we just directly address the
recording dates

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,970
of the record we want to delete in the
body of the internal table.

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,360
And with the delete statement,

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,530
we can also use it inside the loop,
they're exactly the same type of syntax.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,410
So for example, let's copy this loop.

19
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,164
I'm gonna paste it out here.

20
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:31,226
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:31,226 --> 00:01:36,156
What we can do, is if we have some logic
to identify a specific record,

22
00:01:36,156 --> 00:01:37,170
in this case.

23
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:45,157
[BLANK_AUDIO]

24
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:52,077
If our surname equals Smith, we can then
say,

25
00:01:52,077 --> 00:01:57,060
delete a record from my top 01.

26
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,760
We're gonna use the index, but instead of
specifying the number, we can use a system

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,280
variable called sy-index, and when we are
inside the loop,

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:14,230
this variable gets updated automatically
by the system, so if we are in the fifth

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:19,410
iteration of a loop, this variable will
contain the number five.

30
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,599
Which will equal the fifth record in the
table that we want to delete.

31
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,593
[BLANK_AUDIO]

32
00:02:27,593 --> 00:02:30,474
One thing to note is that you shouldn't
use the delete

33
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,660
statement without the index addition.

34
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,640
If you went outside the loop, you will be
given a run time error,

35
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,770
which in turn will cause your program to
crash.

36
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:45,580
If you are inside the loop, you need to
make sure the index

37
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,590
addition is included to be compliant with
future releases.

38
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,410
The ABAP syntax.

39
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,990
I want to introduce the where addition to
the delete statement.

40
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,580
Because there are times when you don't
know the actual

41
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,420
index of the record that you want to
delete.

42
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,700
When your table has a non unique key, you
need to use some other logic, as we've

43
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:12,830
already discussed, to determine which
record or records you want to delete.

44
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,980
And this is where you can use the where
edition.

45
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,350
Now you use the where clause to construct
a logical expression

46
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,880
that contains the various conditions that
will help you identify the record or

47
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,706
records you need to delete as uniquely as
you can.

48
00:03:29,706 --> 00:03:32,620
Now always try and

49
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,460
be as specific as possible when trying to
identify records you want to delete.

50
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,450
Because the last thing you want is to
delete data that

51
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,430
you shouldn't have deleted.

52
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,960
So let's have a look at the code.

53
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,500
It's real simple.

54
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,320
And what we're going to do.

55
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,952
Let's copy this statement here.

56
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:56,100
[UNKNOWN] down, and we'll edit it.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:01,820
So we have delete, and we have the table.

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,717
But instead of using the index, we're
going to say where,

59
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:14,040
and let's use surname again, where surname
equals Smith.

60
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,540
You can see it's very straightforward,

61
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,180
and we have just included one logical
expression

62
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,970
that attempts to identify any records with
the surname Smith that we want to delete.

63
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,650
When a record is found that does match our
logical expression,

64
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:36,230
the record will be removed from the
internal table.

65
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,367
If the system finds multiple records,

66
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:43,765
all the records will be deleted that match
the expression.

67
00:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,859
