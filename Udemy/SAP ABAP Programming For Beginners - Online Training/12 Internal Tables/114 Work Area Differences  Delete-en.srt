00:00:02,770 --> 00:00:06,110
Now the last piece we want to look at in
this small section

2
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,040
is the delete statement.

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,920
And if you remember back when we discussed
the delete statement earlier, we mentioned

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,090
that we didn't use the header records to
identify the record we wanted to delete.

5
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,000
We just specified the table index.

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:26,510
And exactly the same syntax used for
internal tables that use work areas.

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,970
Because we're not touching the header
record at all,

8
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,200
we don't need to touch a work area.

9
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:34,530
So there's actually no difference.

10
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,702
The same syntax applies in both
situations.

11
00:00:37,702 --> 00:00:40,079
