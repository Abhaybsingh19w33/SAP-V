2
00:00:03,045 --> 00:00:06,940
So we've looked at how we can loop through
an internal table.

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:11,800
Now let's have a look at how we can update
the records in the internal table

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,110
using the modify statements.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,700
I will add in some code, and

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,050
whilst I'm writing it see if you can work
out how it all fits together.

7
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:21,150
It's fairly simple.

8
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,045
And then we'll go over it line by line.

9
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:33,045
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:01:15,586 --> 00:01:17,265
Okay, very simple change.

11
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:23,295
You can see I've included an if statement
and also a modify statement.

12
00:01:24,345 --> 00:01:29,765
The if statement allows us to determine if
the employee surname is equal to Jones.

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:34,275
If it is, we are going to [UNKNOWN] date,

14
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:38,880
with the surname of Smith.Then we have an
endif statement.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,570
In fact, let me change this code.

16
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:43,790
That shouldn't be there.

17
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:44,610
It should be there.

18
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:46,990
There we go.

19
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,490
So if the if statement is true, we then
have the modify statement.

20
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,230
Which will take the contents of the
headline that we have just updated and

21
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,200
update the record in the internal table
that

22
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,430
was originally read into the head record.

23
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:07,090
Now, the modify statement has some
specific features

24
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,940
when used inside the loop for an internal
table.

25
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,330
So in our case, modify statement only

26
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,949
changes the contents of the existing line
in the internal table that we have read.

27
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,360
It does not create a brand new record.

28
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,260
If the modify statement is in a loop,

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,978
it is always the current line that is
changed.

30
00:02:28,978 --> 00:02:33,190
But please note, you should not do this

31
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:38,010
if you are trying to modify key fields of
an internal table that use a unique key.

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,040
If the modified statement is used outside
of a loop, we must specify the record

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,350
index number that we want to modify,
because we have got no index number being

34
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,120
monitored by the system automatically like
when we have our code inside a loop.

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,530
Now a little note is the way we use the
modify statements in our example here,

36
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,600
we can only it this way with index tables
and tables with header lines.
