1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:06,310
Before we move on to looking at how we
actually create internal tables, you know,

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,995
the specific syntax, I want to spend a few
moments regarding best practices.

3
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:15,410
SAP has been around for

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,000
a long time, and as such, there are many
programs that exist.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,490
In the current version of SAP software
that themselves have been around for

6
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,560
many years and conform to using the older
style of internal tables in their code.

7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:36,870
When you create your own programs, please
use the newer style.

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,390
This will ensure your programs will be
able to be used well into the future.

9
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:46,690
This does not mean you cant use the older
way of programming.

10
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,120
But if you have a choice, why not use the
newest syntax.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,820
Because everything SAP is developing right
now and

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,030
in the future, we will use the newer
object oriented syntax.

13
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,910
And as we work through how to create
internal tables,

14
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,650
I will cover both the old and the new
style of coding, so

15
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,710
that you are familiar with how ABAP has
changed over the years.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,050
And this will enable you to recognize the
old and

17
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,770
new style of coding in the programs that
you come into contact with.

18
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,510
Now that's enough of that.

19
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:25,894
Let's crack on and have a look at some
code.

20
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:30,559
