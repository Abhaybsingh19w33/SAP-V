1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,130
It's now time to take our first look at an
SAP ABAP program.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:11,570
We're going to fire up the SAP system and
open up the ABAP Workbench.

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,600
Now just before we do this, let's quickly
discuss the structure of an ABAP program.

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,780
As with many other programming languages,

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,280
ABAP programs are normally structured into
two parts.

6
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:32,485
The first part of the program, is what we
consider to be the Declaration Section.

7
00:00:32,485 --> 00:00:37,945
This is where we define the data types,
structures, tables, work

8
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:43,915
area variables and the individual fields
that we want to use inside our programs.

9
00:00:45,725 --> 00:00:49,180
This is also where we would declare global
variables.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,610
That will be available throughout the
individual subsections of our program.

11
00:00:55,070 --> 00:01:00,370
When we create a ABAP program, we not only
declare global variables,

12
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,220
but we have the option to declare
variables

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,909
that are only valid inside specific
sections within our programs.

14
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,920
These sections are commonly referred to as
Internal Processing Blocks.

15
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,670
The Declaration part of our program is
where we will define

16
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,890
the parameters used for our selection
screens for our reports.

17
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,830
Once we have declared tables,

18
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,160
global variables, and data types in the
Declaration Section of our program

19
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,360
We then come on to the second part of an
ABAP Program itself.

20
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,160
And this is where we will write all the
logic for our program.

21
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:43,710
This part of an ABAP program is often
split up

22
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,780
into what we call Processing Blocks.

23
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:50,820
The Processing Blocks that we define
within our programs,

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,870
can be called from Dimpro Processor that
we discussed in previous videos,

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:00,750
depending on the specific rules we create
within our programs.

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,300
These Processing Blocks are nearly always
just small sections of

27
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,890
programming logic that allow us to
encapsulate our code.

28
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:16,520
Let's log onto our SAP system and take a
look at the ABAP Workbench.

29
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,840
We're finally having a look at the SAP
system itself.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,590
When you open this up GUI, you may have a
different menu on the left hand side but

31
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:37,110
I've set it just so that I've got the
minimal sort of menu options

32
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,425
that we want to have a look at during this
ABAP training course.

33
00:02:41,425 --> 00:02:46,795
So the first thing we're gonna do,

34
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:52,350
is have a look at the ABAP Workbench.

35
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,030
Now to get to the Workbench,

36
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,480
we can just use the menu system on the
left hand side here.

37
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,380
If we open up the sub menu, and

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,175
choose tools, then you'll see the AppUp
Workbench.

39
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,640
Open that up, and then you'll see four
different options within.

40
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,390
Now the first thing we want to look at is
just

41
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:21,870
a very quick overview of how we run a
transaction in SAP.

42
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,660
Now hopefully you are all familiar with
this.

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,360
But I'll just show you the two ways.

44
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,390
First of all, you can open up the menu and
when you have an item

45
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,120
that was not look like a forwarder, that's
an actual transaction you can run.

46
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:41,120
So in this case, let's run the object
navigator.

47
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,990
I'll just double click, then we'll see
down here at

48
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:51,290
the bottom of the screen it said starting
the transaction, and then it opens it up.

49
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,240
To come out of the transaction just press
the back button and

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,140
the other way of running a transaction

51
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:07,260
is coming up here to the transaction input
area and

52
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,850
you can key in the technical name of the
transaction itself if you know what it is.

53
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:19,120
Now a little trick so that you become
familiar with all the different SAP

54
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,040
transactions and to make it so that you
don't have to go through the menus

55
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,000
all the time is to have a look, or
navigate to the extras menu.

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,660
Go to Settings.

57
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:36,660
And the dialogue box that comes up has
four options.

58
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,570
Choose the bottom one that says Display
technical names.

59
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,760
Click the little continue icon with the
green tick.

60
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:49,640
And now, it's refreshed the menu, and

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,680
when you navigate inside, we'll go back to
the overview menu again.

62
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,360
You can now see the actual transaction
codes that as you start working with

63
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,110
the SAP system, you'll become familiar
with them and you'll be able to enter them

64
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,030
directly into the input box.

65
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,230
So, let's close this overview menu.

66
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:16,230
And then we will, step-by-step, go through
the different options and

67
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:21,332
I'll highlight the four to five major
pieces of the ABAP Wordbench,

68
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:25,710
that you will become familiar with and you
will use as an ABAP developer.

69
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:32,010
One thing that most of our programs will
have in common, is that they will read or

70
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,220
write data to and from the database tables
within our SAP system.

71
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:44,520
The ABAP Workbench has a transaction to
allow us to create database tables and

72
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,460
also view the fields that make up the
tables themselves and

73
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,800
browse the data inside.

74
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,000
This is called the ABAP dictionary.

75
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:59,390
And you can find the ABAP dictionary by
going through the ABAP workbench menu,

76
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,510
then go down to Development, and

77
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,640
there you'll see it, ABAP dictionary and
its transaction code SE11.

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,980
The next and probably the most used

79
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:17,020
part of the ABAP Workbench is the ABAP
editor.

80
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,760
And this is where we will spend a lot of
our time in this course.

81
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,300
The ABAP editor is where we create all the
code, it's where we build all the logic.

82
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,130
And by using forward navigation

83
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,680
which is a function within an S-A-P system
that we will touch on later.

84
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,340
You can actually define function modules,

85
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:45,710
jump forward to the ABAP dictionary, and
also create screens.

86
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:51,230
The ABAP editor can be found under the
development menu again.

87
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,880
And it's transaction code SE38, the next

88
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,690
most important part of the Workbench is
the Function Build.

89
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,756
The Function Build is very similar to the
ABAP editor but

90
00:07:06,756 --> 00:07:13,110
it's main function is to actually define
specific task,

91
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,020
that can be called from any other program.

92
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,140
You create interfaces in the Function
Builder,

93
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,630
where you define the different data
elements and the different

94
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,580
types of tables that can be passed to and
from the actual function that you build.

95
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,300
We will touch on the Function Builder a
later on

96
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,560
when we encapsulate our programs into
function modules.

97
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,740
The Function Builder can be called from
transaction code SE37.

98
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,370
And, it can normally be

99
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:50,750
found just under the upper ABAP editor
option on the SAP menu tree.

100
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:57,930
Now the next item we want to look at is
called the Menu Painter.

101
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,490
And if you have a look at the user
interface folder, open that up and

102
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,698
you'll see transaction code SE41.

103
00:08:04,698 --> 00:08:10,400
The Menu Painter is a tool that can be
used to generate,

104
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,818
if we look up here we can see menu
options, and we can see buttons.

105
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:19,310
so menu bars.

106
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,790
We can create buttons, icons, menu bars,
transaction

107
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:30,250
input fields and all these can trigger
events within our program.

108
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:36,410
You can define whether the event is
triggered by a mouse click, or

109
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:39,900
by simply pressing a shortcut key on your
keyboard.

110
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,860
An example would be here on this menu bar.

111
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,070
We can see the log off button and we can
see,

112
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,700
this can be triggered by using the shift
and F3 key together.

113
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,310
So the Menu Painter is for building menu
items,

114
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:03,000
menu bars, then the next item on our list
is the Screen Painter.

115
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,620
And that's transaction code, SE51.

116
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,210
Now the Screen Painter as you might guess,

117
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:14,290
allows you to define the user input
screen.

118
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,210
So you can define text boxes, dropdown
menus, list boxes,

119
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:24,460
and input fields, timed areas of the
screen and so on.

120
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,770
It lets you define the whole interface
that the user will use.

121
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,920
And behind all the different fields,

122
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,840
buttons, dropdowns that you put on your
screen, you then

123
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:41,320
define the individual functions that get
called when the user interacts with it.

124
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,290
Now we've saved the best to the last.

125
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:50,740
The last item that we're going to look at
is called the Object Navigator.

126
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:55,190
The Object Navigator is a fantastic tool.

127
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,270
It brings all the other tools together
under one roof.

128
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,380
And gives you a very efficient environment
for you to develop your programs.

129
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,340
When you're building large programs that
have many function modules, many screens,

130
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:15,570
the object navigator is the ideal tool to
use.

131
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:18,450
So that you can navigate all around your
development.

132
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:25,740
You can find the Object Navigator, under
the overview menu

133
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,220
under the ABAP Workbench and it's
transaction code SE80.

134
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,930
So that more or less covers the main
features of the ABAP Workbench

135
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,980
that we will interact with in this ABAP
course.

136
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,745
You will see in the SAP menu tree there
are many,

137
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:50,492
many other transactions that can be used
to help develop your programs,

138
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:55,483
but the ones we have just covered I would
say cover 90 to 95%

139
00:10:55,483 --> 00:10:58,991
of the development tools that you will
use.

140
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:03,112
[BLANK_AUDIO]

141
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:05,730
That brings us to the end of module one.

142
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:11,580
I hope you have found this introduction to
the SAP development environment useful.

143
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,320
And in the next module, module two,

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,100
we're going to start off by looking at the
ABAP dictionary.
