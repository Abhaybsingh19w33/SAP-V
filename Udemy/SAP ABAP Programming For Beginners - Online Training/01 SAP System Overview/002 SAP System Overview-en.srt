00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:07,340
In this module,

00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,640
we're gonna cover the high level
architecture of a standard SAP system.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:18,140
That's gonna include the technical
architecture and platforming dependence.

00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,140
And why that is so cool.

We'll go over the environment that our
programs will run on.

8
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:30,090
This will include the work processes and
the basic structure of an ABAP program.

00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:36,000
Then we'll go onto looking at and running
SAP system.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,700
We'll discuss the business model overview
and

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,970
then we'll get going with the ABAP
