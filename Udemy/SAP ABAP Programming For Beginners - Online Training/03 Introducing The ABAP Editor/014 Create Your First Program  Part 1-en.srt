1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,290
To create our first program from your SAP
[UNKNOWN],

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,880
you can either key in transaction SE38 or

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,250
you can navigate to the ABAP Editor
through the SAP menu tree.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,350
Go to tools, ABAP Workbench Developments

5
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:25,750
and there you'll see SE38 ABAP Editor.

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,030
Double click and execute it.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,350
Now, just before we create out program,
just something to keep in mind.

8
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:38,900
Try and keep your programs as simple as
possible do not make your programs

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,350
any more complicated than they need to be.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:47,320
Now I say this because, through my many
years of experience with SAP,

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,570
more often than not, you have to pick up
somebody else's program, try and

12
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,960
understand it, and either make
enhancements to it, or

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,500
fix bugs that have been identified
sometime after it has gone live.

14
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,658
The worst thing in the world is opening up
a program and seeing 100 and

15
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:11,530
100 of 1000 lines of code with very few
comments and

16
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,200
it takes just an absolute age to
understand.

17
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,790
I advise you all to keep things really
simple.

18
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,540
Add lots of comments into your code, so
that anybody else, and

19
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,480
yourself, that comes to look at the
program later on, can easily understand

20
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,620
what the program is doing, and the flow of
the logic as it's executed.

21
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,820
It makes everybody's life just that much
easier.

22
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
So let's get going.

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,140
We'll enter our first program name.

24
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,090
Now remember, we have to use our customer
naming conventions.

25
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,020
In this case that means we're going to
start the program with the letter Z.

26
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,600
After a Z, you can name it whatever you
want we're

27
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,210
going to stick with the employee theme.

28
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:00,770
That we used when we created our table.

29
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:08,856
So I'm going to enter
said_employee_list_01.

30
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:14,570
You noticed that I used underscores just
to separate the words within the program.

31
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,960
Just to make things a little easier on the
eyes.

32
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:21,670
Ensure that the source code radio button
is selected.

33
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,490
And then click the Create button.

34
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:34,380
We're then presented with this Program
Attributes window.

35
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:39,140
And the first thing you need to key in is
the title for your program.

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:47,795
So I'm just going to enter some text that
describes what the program does.

37
00:02:47,795 --> 00:02:49,839
[SOUND]

38
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:58,836
My Employee List Report.

39
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:02,670
Ensure that the original language is set
to EN, which it is by default.

40
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,940
And just something to note.

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,580
The language of the program

42
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:11,610
has an effect on what text entries are
displayed within certain programs.

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,500
You will see that the original language
field has automatically been filled in

44
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,320
with EN, for English It's important to
note that any text

45
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,290
entries you create within your program are
language specific and

46
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,410
they can be maintained for each country by
using a translation tool.

47
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,020
Now we're not gonna be doing this right
now, but it's just something for

48
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,000
you to keep in mind.

49
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,940
Now come down to the attributes and you'll
see the type click the drop down

50
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:48,570
button and select executable program now
this means

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:53,950
our program can be executed without the
need for us to create a transaction code.

52
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,300
And it also means the program can be run
as a background job.

53
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,360
We'll set the status of our program to
test program and

54
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,550
we'll set the application to basis.

55
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:11,600
Now these two fields are just used to help
manage the program within

56
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,650
the sub system itself.

57
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,780
And it describes what the programs will be
used for, and

58
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,820
also the program development status.

59
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,480
Now we don't need to touch any other field
here.

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,540
So, leave the Authorization Group, Logical
database, and Selection screen empty.

61
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,110
And make sure the Editor lock field is
left clear.

62
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,170
If you do turn on Editor lock it will
prevent the program from being edited.

63
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,850
That's not what we want [LAUGH].

64
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,290
Leave unicode checked active.

65
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,330
And I suggest you always leave it active
for every program you create.

66
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,680
This ensures your program can cater for
multibyte coding.

67
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:59,370
Ensure you leave the fixed point
arithmetic checked,

68
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,690
because without this any packed decimal
fields that we use within our program

69
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,510
will all be rounded to whole numbers.

70
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,350
And we will leave the start using variants
check box blank.

71
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,410
We will touch on variants later on, but
for now just go ahead and

72
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,245
click the Save button.

73
00:05:18,245 --> 00:05:26,758
[SOUND] You should be familiar with this
object directory entry box.

74
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:30,804
And because we're not going to be
transporting our programs,

75
00:05:30,804 --> 00:05:33,857
just click the local object button to
assign our

76
00:05:33,857 --> 00:05:36,850
program to our temporary development
class.

77
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,070
And now you've made it you finally got to
the coding screen.
