1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:06,591
Let's now take a look at declaring the
other type of variable, called constants.

2
00:00:09,328 --> 00:00:14,120
So a constant is a field within our
program whose value

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,450
stays the same during the complete
execution of the program.

4
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,830
We never want it to change.

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:21,500
Hence the term, constant.

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,906
We can declare constants by using the
constants statement instead of

7
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:30,385
the data statement.

8
00:00:30,385 --> 00:00:35,963
And when we declare a constant, we must
also assign a value to that field.

9
00:00:35,963 --> 00:00:41,281
When we are writing code, we can then only
ever reference the constant variable,

10
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,454
but never change the value of it.

11
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:47,424
If you do try and change the value of a
constant within your program,

12
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,711
you'll usually get a runtime error, so
don't try it.

13
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:57,182
[LAUGH] So let's have a look at the syntax
for declaring a constant variable.

14
00:00:57,182 --> 00:01:00,422
The syntax is very similar to the data
statement, but

15
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:02,300
with a few minor differences.

16
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,803
First of all, you have to use the word
constants.

17
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:09,672
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:09,672 --> 00:01:13,660
Give it a name.

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,263
Now, it was supposed to say MYCONSTANT1.

20
00:01:16,263 --> 00:01:21,081
[BLANK_AUDIO]

21
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,462
Give it a type.

22
00:01:22,462 --> 00:01:32,462
[BLANK_AUDIO]

23
00:01:35,235 --> 00:01:36,022
And there we have it.

24
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:38,232
We're done.

25
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:45,093
We want to do another one.

26
00:01:45,093 --> 00:01:50,615
This time we'll make it a normal integer.

27
00:01:50,615 --> 00:01:54,546
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,510
Very easy.

29
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,753
And just one thing to note, you cannot
define

30
00:02:02,753 --> 00:02:07,871
constants for data types, X strings,

31
00:02:07,871 --> 00:02:13,145
for references, internal tables, and

32
00:02:13,145 --> 00:02:18,745
structures containing internal tables.

33
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:28,745
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,869
So just remember,

35
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:38,590
we will come on to those data types at a
later stage of this training program.
