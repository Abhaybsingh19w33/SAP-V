1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:04,960
And I want to introduce something called
Chaining Statements Together.

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,930
You will have noticed in our program,

3
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:11,110
that we are using the right statement
quite a lot.

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:16,180
Now to save us time, we can chain our
right statements together.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:20,438
And this saves us from having to duplicate
the right statement on every

6
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,671
line that we write.

7
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:26,921
So to do this,

8
00:00:26,921 --> 00:00:32,609
I'll copy a new

9
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:39,178
section of code.

10
00:00:39,178 --> 00:00:40,295
Change some clients,

11
00:00:40,295 --> 00:00:47,753
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:47,753 --> 00:00:52,100
And what we do with the WRITE statement is
add a colon after it.

13
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:58,730
This tells the SAP system that our WRITE
statement is going to write

14
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,740
out multiple fields or text literals as we
define.

15
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,940
So, here we have WRITE, new line and the
surname.

16
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,195
We're then gonna change the full stop to a
comma.

17
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:21,795
[NOISE] Get rid of the second WRITE
statement.

18
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,352
Do the same with the third.

19
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:28,140
[NOISE] Edit the code and then when we
have our last

20
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,807
item we want to output with a WRITE
statement,

21
00:01:32,807 --> 00:01:36,170
that's where we put the period.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,330
So what this is basically doing is,

23
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:43,050
the colon says to the system we're going
to output many items.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,690
We separate the items by a comma and we
use the period to terminate the statement.

25
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,050
Very simple, and it can be used for

26
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:54,290
many other statements such as the move
statement.

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,378
So we can execute the code

28
00:01:56,378 --> 00:02:06,504
[BLANK_AUDIO]

29
00:02:06,504 --> 00:02:11,980
And we should see we got exactly the same
output as the one above.

30
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,000
The only difference is we've chained our
write statements together,

31
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,280
saving our precious fingers from too many
key presses.
