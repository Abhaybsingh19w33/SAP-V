1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,527
Before we do execute it, I've noticed a
mistake or two.

2
00:00:03,527 --> 00:00:12,003
[NOISE] Got way too many zeros, oops.

3
00:00:12,003 --> 00:00:14,824
[NOISE] I think it's six,

4
00:00:14,824 --> 00:00:20,336
because I think it's an eight character
field.

5
00:00:20,336 --> 00:00:21,830
Let's go and check.

6
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,310
Yes, it's eight characters.

7
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:32,010
And also, now I think I think

8
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,930
it's it's definitely my keyboard playing
up, it's not me not being able to spell.

9
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:39,340
Honest.
[LAUGH] Okay, so

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,390
now we'll check the program.

11
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,000
Everything's good,

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,670
make sure it's saved, then we'll activate
it, and then we'll test it.

13
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,670
So, if I bring up the database

14
00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:01,878
table as it currently is [SOUND] and view
the data.

15
00:01:01,878 --> 00:01:03,670
There are the current records we have.

16
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,480
So I'll move it over to the side.

17
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,950
We'll execute our program.

18
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,570
Record inserted successfully.

19
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:17,680
So, I'll come back over here and we'll do
a refresh,

20
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,630
and there's our new record at the bottom.

21
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:31,160
So, let's now, just for practice, let's go
through this in d book mode.

22
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,650
Now, we'll change the contents.

23
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,280
No we won't, we'll leave it lying down.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,920
What we'll do is delete the record from
the table.

25
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,170
So whilst we're here, highlight that one,

26
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,295
table entries and choose Delete and it's
gone.

27
00:01:48,295 --> 00:01:52,961
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:54,710
And then, I'll put a break point.

29
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,643
[NOISE] Oops, cursor was

30
00:02:00,643 --> 00:02:06,246
placed on the wrong place,

31
00:02:06,246 --> 00:02:09,420
do apologize.

32
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,870
Just do the breakpoint there.

33
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,681
Okay, now we'll execute the program and
we'll step through it one line at a time

34
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:21,171
and check the value of the SY sub RC
field.

35
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:25,295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:25,295 --> 00:02:27,140
Okay so we're in debug mode.

37
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,920
So press F5 which is the single step.

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,087
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:33,087 --> 00:02:38,160
And you can see here that we're going to
fill our work area.

40
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,860
So what I'll do, I'll double click on the
work area structure up here first.

41
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,050
Now you can see the work area, and

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,650
they actually, if we hover over, you can
see it's completely empty.

43
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,770
But what we'd like to do is display the
whole structure.

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:02,310
So see the individual fields, So, I'm
going to double click it.

45
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,766
And now it's jumped to the structure view,
where we can

46
00:03:06,766 --> 00:03:12,370
see each field within our structure.

47
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,930
Now, due to the limitation in size here,

48
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,840
we can always get very small preview of
the code.

49
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,630
Well let's go to the actual line of code
we're working with.

50
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:26,080
So we have executed this one,

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
and you can see we have filled the
employee field.

52
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:36,980
The next field, surname, gets filled, and
so on for

53
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,430
name, title, date of birth and now we have
the insert statements.

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:48,030
And what I'm gonna do is go back to this
fields view and

55
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:52,456
I'm going to bring up the xy sub rc field.

56
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:55,320
But I say bring up, here it is down here.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,730
It's always on the screen.

58
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:02,045
So at the moment, it has a value of zero,
and as we execute the insert

59
00:04:02,045 --> 00:04:07,830
statements If there were any problems at
all this would change to a four for

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:13,270
a warning and then an eight for an error
or to say it was unsuccessful.

61
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,230
So, let's execute the insert statement.

62
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,350
We can see the value is still 0 so,
everything has worked correctly.

63
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,940
We're now going to clear the sy sub rc
then write out the message

64
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,990
and then the program will finish.

65
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:38,600
Step back to come out

66
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:46,190
and then we'll do a refresh on the table
and there we have it.

67
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,150
The new record has been added.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,700
So that's the insert statement, using a
separate work area.

69
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,070
Now, as we move on, there is a separate
module looking at internal tables

70
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,760
where we will discuss internal tables with
header record and

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,710
internal tables with separate work areas.

72
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,470
So we will come back to the work area
header record topic a bit later on.
