1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,910
Okay, first of all I'm going to
tidy this program up a little bit.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,300
What we will do is now take
a look at the update statements.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:16,830
Now the update statement
allows us to modify one or

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,840
more existing records in
our table at the same time.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,681
Now in this example, we're just
gonna focus on updating one record.

6
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,088
But to update multiple records,
the same sort of thing applies.

7
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:36,390
So just as with the insert statement.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,418
We first of all would declare a work area.

9
00:00:39,418 --> 00:00:43,844
We would then fill our work area
with the data that we want to update

10
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:48,752
the record with, and then proceed to
execute the update statement which

11
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:53,360
would take our data,
update the record in the database.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,850
And then give us back
a return code to tell us

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:58,980
if the update was successful or not.

14
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,070
So as we have already
got a table structure.

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:08,015
Or work area structure should
I say to the y employees.

16
00:01:08,015 --> 00:01:12,289
Let's use them, so
we don't have to declare it again.

17
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:17,979
But what we will do is
change these contents.

18
00:01:20,902 --> 00:01:23,938
So we will let this insert
statement run through.

19
00:01:23,938 --> 00:01:27,897
Insert the record, and then we will
update it with some new values.

20
00:01:33,244 --> 00:01:38,202
And instead of Westmore,
let's use Eastmore, and

21
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:41,926
we will change the guy's name to ANDY.

22
00:01:41,926 --> 00:01:45,963
Now very similar to the insert statement,

23
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:49,561
and I'll copy this checking as well.

24
00:01:54,205 --> 00:01:56,839
What we will do?

25
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:59,320
Is instead of insert, we will use update.

26
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,560
And just like the insert statement,

27
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,510
the simple form would be
just update z employees.

28
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,430
And that would update
using the head of record.

29
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:19,440
But as we don't want to do that,
because it's the old way of doing things,

30
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,196
we want to use our separate work area.

31
00:02:23,196 --> 00:02:27,059
So back in our program,

32
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:31,308
[SOUND] we would say update z

33
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:36,340
employees from our work area.

34
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,710
So that's it,
we don't need to do any more coding.

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,930
Let's just test this out.

36
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:43,200
So I'll Save the program.

37
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,080
Let's make sure it compiles okay.

38
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,255
Oop, we do have a problem.

39
00:02:47,255 --> 00:02:47,945
Let's have a look.

40
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,235
Missing period.

41
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:52,495
Oh!
Just off the endif.

42
00:02:52,495 --> 00:02:53,274
There we go.

43
00:02:56,897 --> 00:02:59,381
Everything looks good.

44
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:00,832
We'll put a break point in.

45
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,612
And run through.

46
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:12,582
So we're going to insert our record,
check for

47
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:15,449
the SY sub RC on the insert.

48
00:03:15,449 --> 00:03:19,292
Yes, it's zero so everything is good.

49
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:20,740
And now we're gonna get to the update.

50
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,690
So the first thing, which I forgot to do,
but it doesn't really matter in this case,

51
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,820
is I should have used the clear statement,

52
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,880
and cleared out employee surname and
fullname, but

53
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:40,490
because we're updating every single
field again, it won't really matter.

54
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:42,240
So I'll step through.

55
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,000
The employee is exactly the same.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,475
Our surname will change to EASRMORE.

57
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:52,980
Fullname to ANDY.

58
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:01,036
Mr. date of birth,
now the next one is the update statement.

59
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:07,052
So first of all while we're here,
let's bring through the other section.

60
00:04:07,052 --> 00:04:13,041
We'll do a Refresh,
there's our new record.

61
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:18,268
Let's go back and execute this update.

62
00:04:18,268 --> 00:04:23,550
SY-SUBRC is 0, so
that indicates everything is good.

63
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,065
Oh, and look, I didn't update the actual
comment to say, record updated correctly.

64
00:04:29,065 --> 00:04:30,725
Never mind.

65
00:04:30,725 --> 00:04:35,639
But, because the update has been executed,
if I do a refresh,

66
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,442
we should see each Eastmore changed to,
sorry,

67
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:44,938
we should see Westmore changed to
Eastmore and Bruce changed to Andy.

68
00:04:44,938 --> 00:04:47,912
There we go.

69
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,896
And now just press F8 to zoom
to the end of the program.

70
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:56,189
And there's that output.

71
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:08,083
Represent that breakpoint and just for
completing this I am going to change this.

72
00:05:17,371 --> 00:05:23,258
And it would be nice to put these

73
00:05:23,258 --> 00:05:27,588
these are menu line on it.

74
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:28,308
There we go.

75
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,032
You know, what data is it?

76
00:05:33,032 --> 00:05:33,880
For the update statements.
