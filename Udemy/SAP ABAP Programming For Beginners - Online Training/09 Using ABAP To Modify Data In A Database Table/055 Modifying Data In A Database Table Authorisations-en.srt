00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:05,750
When we are writing our programs using
open SQL,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,130
we need to bare in mind the concepts of
authorization in an SAP system.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,500
Now an SAP system has its own security

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,800
tools to ensure users can only access the
data they are authorized to see.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,860
This includes individual fields as well as
individual records.

6
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:33,980
The way authorizations are set up can also
limit how the data is used.

7
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:38,460
Whether a user can only display
information or whether they can modify

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,170
the data such as adding, changing, and
even deleting records.

9
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,910
And all these rules that make up a user's
authorizations

10
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:51,140
as stored as authorization objects.

11
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,800
Now we're not gonna dig deep into
authorizations here, but

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,840
as a general rule a user is assigned a
relevant authorization profile or

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,770
composite profile against there user
record.

14
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,300
Which for informational purposes is
managed through transaction SU Z01.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,210
This authorization profile

16
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,720
then gives the user the correct rites to
carry out their job and SAP

17
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,490
delivers lots of predefined authorization
profiles with their bay system.

18
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:30,290
The system of administrators can use and
enhance to apply to their users

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,200
for example, there are standard developer
roles or HR administrator roles.

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,410
The system administrators more than likely
take these delivered

21
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:47,320
authorization profiles files, tweak them a
little bit to ensure they work

22
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,450
just how their company wants them to work,
and then apply them to individual users.

23
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,600
Once a user is assigned a role, and

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,550
tries to execute a program, depending on
the authorization role of the user,

25
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,010
they will be allowed to execute the
transaction or not.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,680
And a typical example is being able to run
transaction SE38.

27
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,390
The ABAP editor.

28
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:15,020
A user can be given a role to allow them
to access that transaction, but

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,380
also it can be tweaked so that yeah, they
can access it, but only in display mode.

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,900
Or in a live system maybe, they can access
the transaction in display mode.

31
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,500
And be allowed to debug the program in the
live environment, but

32
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,960
not be able to make changes to the code
itself.

33
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:40,250
So coming back to our ABAP programs, where
specific authorizations have

34
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:45,170
not been implemented we can get our
programmers to carry out an authority

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:50,220
check using the ABAP statement authority
check.

36
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,200
This has to be used if the transaction or

37
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,330
the ABAP program itself is not
sufficiently protected

38
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,770
by the standard authorization profiles
already set up in the system.

39
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,000
Now, we won't go any further into
authorization checking in this course

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,270
because it is a massive topic in itself.

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:14,280
But you do need to be aware of
authorizations.

42
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,177
And make sure any programs that you create
take into account authorizations

43
00:03:19,177 --> 00:03:22,161
already set up by the system or, if
required,

44
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:26,464
implement your own authorization checking,
as just mentioned.

45
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:29,719
