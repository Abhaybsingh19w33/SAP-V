1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:04,770
For our next topic we are going to look at
the modify statements,

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,430
now the modify statement is like a
combination of the insert statement and

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,450
the update statements.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:20,020
You can use it to either insert a brand
new record, or modify an existing one.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,010
But in general, you want to use the insert
and update statements where you can.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,680
Don't be lazy and always try and use the
modify statement.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:32,630
The insert and update command, offer
greater clarity to those

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:37,040
people reading your code, and it's clear
to you when you're writing your code.

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,890
You know exactly what the code is doing.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,510
Now there are times when you have to use
the modified statements,

11
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:48,160
because sometimes you will be writing
code, that either has to insert or

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,910
update a record, depending on certain
situations.

13
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,620
And the modify statement is fine to use in
that regard.

14
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,790
So let's have a look now what the modify
statement looks like,

15
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:02,560
and I'm sure it'll be of no surprise to
you.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,157
It follows the, similar syntax of the
other statements.

17
00:01:09,157 --> 00:01:11,285
So again, I'm gonna copy some code.

18
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:21,285
[BLANK_AUDIO]

19
00:01:32,341 --> 00:01:37,005
And we'll first of all take a look at that
basic syntax.

20
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,998
Oops, shouldn't have double clicked.

21
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:49,421
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:54,459
And this is it, a simple modify zed
employees and as with the other

23
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:59,805
statements, this will use the header
record of the internal table.

24
00:01:59,805 --> 00:02:01,385
But we do not want that.

25
00:02:01,385 --> 00:02:03,395
We want to use the work area.

26
00:02:03,395 --> 00:02:05,638
So,-
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:02:05,638 --> 00:02:10,632
Our modified statement looks very similar
to the others where we will

28
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:14,605
modify our table, then employees from our
work area.

29
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,380
Now when the modified statement is
executed, the primary key fields

30
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:25,850
from your work area, will be checked
against those records held in the table.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,650
If a record exists,

32
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,650
that record will be updated with the
content held in your work area.

33
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,890
If the record doesn't exist,

34
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:40,330
then a new record will be inserted at the
end of the table.

35
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:45,140
And that's with the other statements, if a
modified statement is unable to execute

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:50,800
either of these two tasks, the SY sub R C
field, will return with a value of 4,

37
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,330
but if it's a successful, it will contain
a value of 0.

38
00:02:57,035 --> 00:02:58,078
So let's go ahead.

39
00:02:58,078 --> 00:03:03,662
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:05,565
[LAUGH] And let's stick with this theme.

41
00:03:05,565 --> 00:03:08,133
And actually call this guy Northmore.

42
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:14,760
[NOISE] First name of Peter.

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,622
So this should update the existing record.

44
00:03:19,622 --> 00:03:24,519
[NOISE] Change this to modified.

45
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,197
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:31,197 --> 00:03:34,773
Outputs on a new line.

47
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:36,133
And then what we will do.

48
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:41,725
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:41,725 --> 00:03:45,801
We will look at the second scenario,

50
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:51,140
where the record doesn't currently exist.

51
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,880
So it should insert a record.

52
00:03:55,965 --> 00:04:03,122
[SOUND] These are really bad names I'm
choosing, but nevermind.

53
00:04:03,122 --> 00:04:10,256
[SOUND]
There we go.

54
00:04:10,256 --> 00:04:14,530
[BLANK_AUDIO]

55
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,070
So let's recap the code.

56
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,030
Tell you what.

57
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:27,235
Let's do what I should've been doing
anyway, and set the CLEAR statement.

58
00:04:27,235 --> 00:04:30,397
[SOUND] There we go.

59
00:04:30,397 --> 00:04:32,061
So now we'll recap.

60
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:36,814
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:40,690
So the program will insert a record first
of 06.

62
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:45,775
It will then update 06 with a surname and
forename.

63
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:52,790
Then, we will get to our modify statement,
where because we are using the correct

64
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:58,800
key, the action performed will be the same
as the update.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,500
We will update the surname and the
forename.

66
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,970
Then we'll come down to the modify again,
but this time,

67
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,720
because it's a unique key, a brand new
key, we're going to add a new record.

68
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,450
So let's do a syntax check.

69
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,150
We'll pretty it up first, yeah.

70
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:21,310
Syntax, and we'll activate.

71
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,530
Let's check our data in the other session.

72
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,625
We'll get rid of 06 first.

73
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:37,352
[SOUND]
Refresh.

74
00:05:37,352 --> 00:05:38,940
Oh, it's already refreshed.

75
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,380
So we've, we've got to oh five.

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,100
So let's debug our code.

77
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:50,268
[SOUND] F8 and now we

78
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:55,760
will step through.

79
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,467
[BLANK_AUDIO]

80
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,990
There's our insert statements.

81
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,580
Everything is good.

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,331
Do a quick refresh.

83
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,739
There's our record, Mister Westmore.

84
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:24,123
Now we will do the update, change his name
to Eastmore and Andy.

85
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:29,877
Everything is good with the SY sub RC.

86
00:06:29,877 --> 00:06:33,731
Let's do a refresh, there's Eastmore.

87
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:36,107
And now we get onto our modify statement.

88
00:06:36,107 --> 00:06:42,299
[BLANK_AUDIO]

89
00:06:42,299 --> 00:06:46,445
We'll do the modify.

90
00:06:46,445 --> 00:06:48,600
SY- sub RC0 so everything is good.

91
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,090
Do a refresh, we've changed to Northmore
and Peter,

92
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:03,250
and the last one, this is where we will do
the modify statement again,

93
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,630
but it should insert a brand new records.

94
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,630
We've executed the clear statement, white
everything out,

95
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:16,340
generating a brand

96
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:21,330
new record, Modify.

97
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,890
SY sub RC 0.

98
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,510
White out the success statements of the
report.

99
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,429
Do a refresh.

100
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,114
And there's our brand new record.

101
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:37,678
[BLANK_AUDIO]

102
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:39,366
Let's move on.
