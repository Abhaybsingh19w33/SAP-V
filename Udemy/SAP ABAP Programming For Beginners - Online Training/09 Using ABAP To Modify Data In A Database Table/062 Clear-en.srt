1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:07,340
Now at this point, I want to introduce a
new statement called the clear statement.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,890
And the reason why I want to do this is
because,

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:18,580
in our other programs, you won't just see
programs that start at the top,

4
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:22,450
fill data like we have just done, do the
insert,

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,140
check that it was successful and then
process another record.

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,910
You would have loops set up and things
like that so

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:34,000
that you can write just a small section of
code, that maybe could insert 100 records.

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,120
And to do that, we're going to reuse
variables and

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,850
structures in our program over and over
again, so

10
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,830
the clear statement, enables us to clear
out a field,

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:52,260
a variable or structure, so that we can
reuse it and make sure that

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,800
none of the data that currently exists in
the structure Get supply to a new record.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,420
Now you will see the clear statement being
used in awful lots of programs.

14
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,960
Because every program that makes use of
existing fields within that program,

15
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,340
time and time again.

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,020
So in the scenario we have here, we fill
our work area with data.

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,100
Let's take off this break point.

18
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,998
And this one up here that I set
accidentally.

19
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:30,310
So, our program fills our work area,
structure,

20
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,470
then inserts the data into the table, and
then we do some validation checking.

21
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,855
Well, now if we want to insert a new
record, in this case all I'm going to do,

22
00:01:43,855 --> 00:01:45,570
is just copy the code.

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:53,750
Add just a little break there just to show
that we've got something new.

24
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,330
Change the employee number.

25
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,710
So now to do this, well, let's say, this
didn't exist.

26
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:13,230
If we did an insert statement, again at
this point, our work area

27
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,710
contains all the values from our previous
insert and we wouldn't want that.

28
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,700
We want to clear it out.

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,110
So once you finish working with a variable
or structure.

30
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,920
Use the clear statement and specify what
you

31
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,180
are going to clear out.

32
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,560
You have a couple of options.

33
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,030
If we use clear WA employees, is gonna
clear the complete structure, so

34
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:49,010
every field within the structure would be
wiped clean.

35
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,545
Alternatively, you can specify individual
fields.

36
00:02:52,545 --> 00:02:58,969
[SOUND] So let's bring back in the fields
we commented out.

37
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:08,894
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:12,180
Just so oh, we'll just leave them like
that.

39
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:16,489
And then we'll, we'll run our program in
[UNKNOWN] mode.

40
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,290
So you can see the clear statement in
action.

41
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:22,480
So first of all we'll check the program.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,390
Everything is good.

43
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,320
And we'll activate it.

44
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,700
Set a break point.

45
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,310
And let's go.

46
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,460
So instead of, well, I'll do it again.

47
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:42,847
I'll double-click zed employees, which is
the whole structure, but this time,

48
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,658
let's do the individual fields.

49
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:47,756
I'm just going to double-click each field
and as you can see,

50
00:03:47,756 --> 00:03:49,638
it's added to the list at the bottom.

51
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:52,833
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,434
And we'll wipe this one out.

53
00:03:54,434 --> 00:04:00,297
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:04:00,297 --> 00:04:02,080
Oops, sorry, wiped them all out.

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,310
Start again.
Let's do these four.

56
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:09,259
I could do a fifth, but we'd have to page
down.

57
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:12,557
So see the date of birth, so I'll just
keep it at four.

58
00:04:12,557 --> 00:04:18,296
I'll do F5 to go step by step and we can
see everything being inserted,

59
00:04:18,296 --> 00:04:24,051
and the insert statement, the record gets
written into the database.

60
00:04:24,051 --> 00:04:29,406
Now, we still have the original record in
the database, and check this out.

61
00:04:29,406 --> 00:04:33,054
Our SY sub RC has given us a return value
of 4,

62
00:04:33,054 --> 00:04:36,520
indicating we've got some sort of error.

63
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,330
So now our WRITE statement will write out
the return code to the report,

64
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,410
telling us about the error.

65
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,860
And this is because the record already
exists.

66
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,630
So we're trying to create a brand new
record with the same key.

67
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,010
And, and this just won't work.

68
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,180
Our table requires unique records.

69
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,480
So the system here is saying uh-uh,

70
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,200
the insert statement didn't execute
properly We have a problem.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,150
It's giving us the return code, we are
checking for

72
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,430
it, and then it's going to write out this
comment to the report.

73
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,080
And now we come to our clear statement.

74
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,220
This is what I wanted to demonstrate, not
so much the error.

75
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:25,450
But we're going to execute the clear
statements on this individual field.

76
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,380
And it's going to clear out employee only.

77
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,810
There we go.

78
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:32,570
See it's been initialized to zeros.

79
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,820
We don't have the clear statement for
surname and forname.

80
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,970
But because we are filling all the fields
again, there's the employee number.

81
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,410
Everything will work.

82
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,550
But in practice, I should of cleared out
the whole stretcher not

83
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:50,710
the employee, so we go along.

84
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,020
Insert, this time we do have a unique
record,

85
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,410
because we changed the employee number.

86
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:59,940
So we can see SY sub RC0 and

87
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,840
this time it will write out a row saying
record inserted correctly.

88
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:09,254
And that's the end of our program.

89
00:06:09,254 --> 00:06:11,728
And there we can see the first one.

90
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:15,593
We have a return code of four and

91
00:06:15,593 --> 00:06:19,910
then record inserted correctly.

92
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:24,290
So, before I forget, I'm gonna wipe out
these records.

93
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:26,690
Right now.

94
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:30,209
If I do a refresh, yeah we'll see the
seventh one.

95
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:41,145
[BLANK_AUDIO]

96
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:43,481
There we go, we're back to where we were.

97
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:51,420
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,190
Let's move on to the update statements.
