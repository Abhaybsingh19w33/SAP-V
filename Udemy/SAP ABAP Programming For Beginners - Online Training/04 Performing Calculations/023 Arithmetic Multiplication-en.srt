[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,461
And the last one we'll try, oops.

3
00:00:05,461 --> 00:00:10,295
[BLANK_AUDIO]

4
00:00:10,295 --> 00:00:12,711
As you can guess, is multiplication.

5
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:17,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:18,390
And there we go.

7
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,045
All very simple.

8
00:00:23,045 --> 00:00:29,645
Now just before we move on to the topic of
conversion rules,

9
00:00:29,645 --> 00:00:35,585
I'll just add in that when we talk about
arithmetic,

10
00:00:35,585 --> 00:00:43,109
you also have the option of using some
other statements called ADD,

11
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:47,212
SUBTRACT, DIVIDE, and MULTIPLY.

12
00:00:47,212 --> 00:00:53,373
Now the syntax for these is a little bit
different,

13
00:00:53,373 --> 00:00:58,530
because the way it works, let's make that

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,128
into a comment, is we can say ADD 8 to
result.

15
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:09,801
And then 8 would contain, let's have a
look in this case,

16
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:15,253
22 plus, that's 27.5 plus 8 would be 35.5.

17
00:01:15,253 --> 00:01:25,253
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,462
Let's do a syntax check.

19
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:33,503
Haven't used this in years, actually.

20
00:01:33,503 --> 00:01:35,446
Hope I got, yeah, I got it right.

21
00:01:35,446 --> 00:01:38,963
[LAUGH] Let's just test it out.

22
00:01:38,963 --> 00:01:43,754
Here we go.
So we can see the result is 35.5.

23
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:46,810
So it's adding in the value of 8 to
result.

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,860
But I've gotta say you hardly ever see
this used in programs.

25
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,100
And why would you want to use it when you
can use really simple

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,530
calculations just like this?
