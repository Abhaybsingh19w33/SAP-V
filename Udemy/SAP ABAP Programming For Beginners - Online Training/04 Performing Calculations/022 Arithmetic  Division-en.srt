1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,104
The next one,
let's have a look at division.

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,833
Simple/ just a division sign.

3
00:00:19,244 --> 00:00:21,495
See the results.

4
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:27,432
And we get a 4.

5
00:00:27,432 --> 00:00:31,364
You know what, that was by pure chance.

6
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:39,250
[LAUGH] I didn't expect it to be a whole
number, but yes, 5.5 multiply by 4 is 22.

7
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,980
If we did have a decimal within
the result it would have been shown.
