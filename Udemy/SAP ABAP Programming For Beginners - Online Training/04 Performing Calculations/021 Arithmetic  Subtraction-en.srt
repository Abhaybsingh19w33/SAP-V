1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,721
Let's now have a very quick look at
subtraction.

2
00:00:04,721 --> 00:00:11,281
[BLANK_AUDIO]

3
00:00:11,281 --> 00:00:19,760
If I just copy the previous example.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,740
So all I'm doing is changing the plus to a
minus.

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,590
And then I'll take, take away the minus
five point five from 22.

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,860
So I guess, in my eyes, I was going to add
it to it.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,670
There we go.
So 22 minus, minus five point five,

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:40,590
is 27 point five.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,230
I'll tell you what

10
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:49,960
I'm gonna do right now,

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,340
is take away this minus sign so it's a bit
easier to to understand.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,980
Well, for my old brain, anyway.

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:02,610
So I'll do a quick test, 22 minus 5.5 is
then 16.5.
