1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:05,500
Just as we did with Do loops, we can also
nest While loops.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:09,670
The process is exactly the same.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,690
So, we're not gonna spend too long on
this, but

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,900
I will do the code so it gives you an
example.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,749
And then we will just zoom straight
through the code.

6
00:00:19,749 --> 00:00:22,325
So, I generate some space.

7
00:00:22,325 --> 00:00:26,210
And we'll follow the example we did in the
Do

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,855
loop, so we will use the a, the b, and the
c variables.

9
00:00:31,855 --> 00:00:34,800
So, the first thing we need to do.

10
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,205
Is initialize our b variable.

11
00:00:41,205 --> 00:00:43,806
And then we'll create another While loop.

12
00:00:43,806 --> 00:00:48,460
Our b [INAUDIBLE] equal to ten.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,277
We can write our total statement, and
obviously,

14
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:54,777
we need to use the copy and paste.

15
00:00:54,777 --> 00:01:00,667
[SOUND] And then it's important at this
point,

16
00:01:00,667 --> 00:01:04,896
to make sure we increment b, so,

17
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:11,702
just as we did with a, we'll increment b
right here.

18
00:01:11,702 --> 00:01:13,065
So, b equals b plus 1.

19
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:18,865
If we didn't do that, we'd end up with a
continuous loop,

20
00:01:18,865 --> 00:01:23,045
it would never end, and we would be stuck.

21
00:01:23,045 --> 00:01:25,911
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:27,851
So, we have that.

23
00:01:27,851 --> 00:01:30,290
We'll bring that line back up.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,298
Then we'll increment c.

25
00:01:33,298 --> 00:01:39,996
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:43,898
So, c equals c plus b, once that inner
loop ends.

27
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:47,843
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:47,843 --> 00:01:55,216
And we can have our last endwhile, and
then write out our final line.

29
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:58,037
[SOUND]

30
00:01:58,037 --> 00:02:04,246
There we go.

31
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:06,920
So, I'll just have a final check, we're
incrementing a.

32
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,083
Resetting b, incrementing b.

33
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:16,447
That will do it, until it reaches the
tenth iteration.

34
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,105
We write out b, increment c.

35
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:21,044
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:21,044 --> 00:02:21,640
Oh.

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,750
And there's one more.

38
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,168
I need to increment c here, with a value
of a.

39
00:02:26,168 --> 00:02:32,784
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,550
There we go.

41
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,475
[SOUND] Have a code check, then activate
it.

42
00:02:39,475 --> 00:02:40,870
And then we'll run straight through.

43
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,430
I don't think I've got a breakpoint set.

44
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,000
Nope.

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,800
There we go,

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,270
so we, we have the same type of result, as
we did with the Nested Do loop.

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,782
We can see our outer loop.

48
00:02:55,782 --> 00:03:00,874
And the cycle of ten inner loop
statements, outer,

49
00:03:00,874 --> 00:03:06,195
and then inner, and so o,n until we get to
the bottom,

50
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,722
where we can see a total of 165
iterations.

51
00:03:10,722 --> 00:03:11,941
Let's move on.

52
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,640
