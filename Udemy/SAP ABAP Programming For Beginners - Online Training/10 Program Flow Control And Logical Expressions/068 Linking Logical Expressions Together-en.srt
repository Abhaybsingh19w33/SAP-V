[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:02,276 --> 00:00:07,500
We have a whole set of ABAP operators that
we can use with our logics things.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,920
So, as we have seen with the if statement
we've been using the equals.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,380
We also can use the not equal to, which is
the less than and

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,350
greater than sign together.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:26,132
The less than, the greater than, less than
and equal to and the greater than and

7
00:00:26,132 --> 00:00:32,371
equal to now, ABAP, because of its roots,
also has some other way to writing these.

8
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:36,214
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:36,214 --> 00:00:41,937
And these are the EQ for equals and E for
not equals.

10
00:00:41,937 --> 00:00:43,377
And you can work the rest out.

11
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:49,290
Less than, greater than, less than or
equal to and greater than or equal to.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:52,280
More and more you, you tend not to see
these being used too much and

13
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,700
I suggest you don't use them because

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:00,490
everyone's now familiar with the standard
way of writing these operators.

15
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:04,720
And like I mentioned in the previous video
we're not just limited to these,

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,890
we can link logical expressions together
using the or

17
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,690
operator the and operator and the not
operator.

18
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,590
We will come onto these in the examples
that follow.

19
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,190
So we can link our logical expressions
together, just like this.

20
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,230
Let's copy the if statement for surname.

21
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:34,800
And instead of a full stop here,

22
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:41,070
we can then use one of the linking
operators, in our case, AND

23
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,530
we'll say forename equals John.

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,640
So there you can see, we've used the AND
operator to link

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,550
two logical expressions together in this
one IF statement.

26
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,685
[SOUND]

27
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:06,562
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:02:06,562 --> 00:02:13,377
[SOUND] So the rest of the code to make up
the statement would be like this.

29
00:02:13,377 --> 00:02:14,782
Very simple one.

30
00:02:14,782 --> 00:02:19,710
The right statement represents our
statement locker code that we would want

31
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,340
to execute, and then we close the if
statement with the end if command.

32
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,830
So that's using and.

33
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:33,666
We can also say if Smith, sorry, if
surname equals Smith or

34
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:37,740
full name equals John, execute the code.
