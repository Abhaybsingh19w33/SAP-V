In this section of the course,

3
00:00:04,197 --> 00:00:08,880
we're going to take a look at program flow
control and logical expressions.

4
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,200
This really is the meat of ABAP program.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,290
This is where it all happens.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,800
How you structure your program using
logical expressions.

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,870
Determine the complete flow of your
program and

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,200
in what sequence actions are taken.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,990
So first of all, let's have a look at
control structures.

10
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,200
Now, when we create a program,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,620
we break a program up into some multiple
tasks and subtasks.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,450
We control how and when these sections of
our program are executed

13
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,900
using logical expressions and

14
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,700
conditional loops, often referred to as
control structures.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,760
So, let's get straight down to the ABAP
code, and

16
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,040
have a look at how we define these control
structures.

17
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,975
To make it easy to understand what I'm
talking about.
