1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,320
Now, let's have a look at nested ifs.

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:12,530
Now as you can see, with our else if, we
are nesting our logic just one level deep.

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,010
We're saying, if this do this.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,180
Else this, do this.

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:21,450
Now with a nested if, we can go down to a
more detailed level.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,499
Let's have a look at an example.

7
00:00:24,499 --> 00:00:24,999
[BLANK_AUDIO]

8
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:34,999
[BLANK_AUDIO]

9
00:00:37,515 --> 00:00:40,599
So, first of all, we have if surname
equals Smith,

10
00:00:40,599 --> 00:00:42,853
we're going to write something out.

11
00:00:42,853 --> 00:00:47,375
Well, at this point, with a nested if, we
can say.

12
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:50,444
[BLANK_AUDIO]

13
00:00:50,444 --> 00:00:56,040
If forename equals John.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:06,200
[BLANK_AUDIO]

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,536
Else, we can say,

16
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:15,685
oh, yeah, so close.

17
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:21,019
[SOUND] And then we end this if block with
this

18
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:25,915
line of code [SOUND] Let's pretty it up.

19
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:26,565
And go through it.

20
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:33,560
So we have our first [UNKNOWN] statement
if Surname equals Smith.

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,085
Then, instead of writing out, you've won a
car.

22
00:01:39,085 --> 00:01:43,618
[SOUND] We're nesting another if
statement.

23
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:46,416
Saying if forename equals John.

24
00:01:46,416 --> 00:01:51,159
Now for completing this, just know just
don't create it forenames.

25
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:55,379
So, let's stick that in there.

26
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:55,879
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:05,879
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,033
[SOUND] Okay.

29
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:20,981
So, if your forename equals John, you've
won a car.

30
00:02:20,981 --> 00:02:27,358
Else, oh, you were so close so we are
checking two logical expressions.

31
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:30,308
To win a car, you've got to have a name of
Smith and

32
00:02:30,308 --> 00:02:32,640
you've got to have a forename of John.

33
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,328
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:34,328 --> 00:02:40,656
And then for each if statement, we close
it with a corresponding end if.

35
00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:44,198
[BLANK_AUDIO]

36
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:49,794
Now you are not limited just to nesting,
you know, down to two levels.

37
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,957
You can go on to your heart's content.

38
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:57,492
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:04,747
You could do a third level [SOUND] if we
print Europe.

40
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:05,433
It should indent it for us.

41
00:03:05,433 --> 00:03:07,784
So you could have something else.

42
00:03:07,784 --> 00:03:11,904
If the surname is Smith and the forename
is John.

43
00:03:11,904 --> 00:03:14,215
And then, and, you know, another field
here.

44
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:19,318
Location UK.

45
00:03:19,318 --> 00:03:24,180
I know we haven't defined it as a field,
but you get the idea.

46
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,610
We can keep embedding logic like this
until it meets all the criteria for

47
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,900
your program.

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,090
And you don't always have to nest if
statements one after another,

49
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,270
just like in this case.

50
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:41,288
We could have
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:47,314
A bunch of statements here, a bunch of
statements here,

52
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:53,729
some more statements, some more statements
at this point.

53
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:57,012
So going back to when we started this
exercise,

54
00:03:57,012 --> 00:04:00,719
we're looking at we define our controls
structure.

55
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:07,065
We then execute some code, then we close
our control structure.

56
00:04:08,155 --> 00:04:11,655
So the code that we execute can be
anything at all.

57
00:04:11,655 --> 00:04:15,615
Writing, reading from database tables,

58
00:04:15,615 --> 00:04:19,635
more logical statements such as the
embedative.

59
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:24,840
You can introduce loops, call function
modules anything you can think of.

60
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,150
And that's really it for the if statement.

61
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,910
That's the structure.

62
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,732
You have the if, you have the else if, you
have the else and

63
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,100
then the end if to close off the block.

64
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:44,270
And you can nest if statements and other
logic statements as deep as you wish.

65
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,560
So, the if statement analyzes a logical
expression, and

66
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,445
like any other programming language, we
are not just limited did to unequal.

67
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:56,235
We can use any logical expression.

68
00:04:56,235 --> 00:05:01,635
We can use the equal, not equal, less
than, greater than, the or,

69
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,645
the and, the nots and so on.

70
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:08,975
So let's have a look at some of those, and
see how they are written in our-
