1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,690
I want you to keep in mind that when you
create logical expressions,

2
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:11,840
and especially linking logical expressions
together

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,700
it's always best to make sure your code is
as readable as possible.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:24,318
And the reason why I say this is because
if you you know,

5
00:00:24,318 --> 00:00:29,628
start producing code just like this.

6
00:00:29,628 --> 00:00:31,885
Well, even though it will work, you know,

7
00:00:31,885 --> 00:00:34,336
we're linking lots of expressions
together.

8
00:00:34,336 --> 00:00:36,410
Ahh, boy, it's so difficult to read.

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:41,640
So try and limit the number of logical
expressions you do link together,

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,190
you know, structure your code a little bit
differently,

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,025
where you might use multiple single
logical expressions.

12
00:00:50,025 --> 00:00:54,402
One after another or if you don't want to
do that,

13
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:59,211
at least structure your code so it is
easier on the eye.

14
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:02,170
[SOUND] For example, we can line things up
like this

15
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:10,045
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:01:10,045 --> 00:01:10,970
And so on.

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,280
I won't keep going, but you get the idea.

18
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,570
It's a lot easier to read something like
that than the code we had before.

19
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,130
Now this brings us on to the next
statement I want us to go through and

20
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,270
that is, the case statement.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,810
The case statement does a similar job to
the IF statement, but

22
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,350
it has the flexibility to structure our
code so it's a lot more readable, but

23
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,030
at the same time is limited to one logical
expression.

24
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,690
Let's take a look at the case statement so
it's easier to understand.

25
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:51,754
So we will start a new block of code let's
have a separator here.

26
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:59,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

27
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:03,164
And we will begin the case statement with
the word case, and

28
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:08,210
we will use the surname and forename that
we have used previously.

29
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,250
So I will write the code first, have a
look at the structure of the statement,

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,730
and then we'll compare it to see how it
differs from the IF statement.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,980
So we have case surname full stop

32
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:30,413
then we can include the word when and this
is where we put our Values.

33
00:02:30,413 --> 00:02:38,650
Let's copy this write statement to save

34
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,110
me typing.

35
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,850
I'm sure I've got a Jones a little further
up.

36
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,365
I certainly do.

37
00:02:53,365 --> 00:02:57,461
Mr. Jones, Windsor Plain.

38
00:02:57,461 --> 00:03:07,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

39
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:24,021
[SOUND] I'll introduce a new MR,

40
00:03:24,021 --> 00:03:28,200
MR Green and Mr.

41
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:35,671
Green well he wins the boats.

42
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:41,085
And last but not least we have our closing
when.

43
00:03:41,085 --> 00:03:43,836
And we say when others.

44
00:03:43,836 --> 00:03:53,836
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:03:55,128 --> 00:04:01,980
Now lastly, we end the case statement with
endcase.

46
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,100
So let's pretty it up.

47
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,540
Get the indenting correct.

48
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,550
So now let's go through the case statement
again.

49
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:18,850
So the first thing we do, is we use the
word case, and we say case field name so

50
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:23,050
in our case, it's case surname, and we are
checking the contents of surname.

51
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:27,190
And we are going to perform an action
depending on its value.

52
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,540
So we are saying when the surname equals
Smith, you've won a car.

53
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,590
When it's Jones, you've won a plane.

54
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,620
When it's Green, you've won a boat.

55
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,910
And anything else with when others, you
don't win anything.

56
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,150
Unlucky.

57
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,930
And then we close the case statement.

58
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,780
Now personally I think the case statement
is much easier to read

59
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,840
than lots of nested and linked IF
statements.

60
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,500
And when we look at the differences with
the case statement compared to the IF

61
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,240
statement well just as I mentioned the
case statement

62
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,116
can only check one field whereas the IF
statement,

63
00:05:09,116 --> 00:05:14,410
by using linked expressions, we can check
multiple fields.

64
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,037
Just like here, we're checking the surname
and forename field.

65
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:24,580
So this is a limitation with a case
statement,

66
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,485
you just checked one field, but I still
like it.

67
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:33,310
[LAUGH] There's not much more to explain
about the case statement.

68
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,740
But before we move on I will just mention
just like with the IF statement,

69
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,330
case statements can be nested.

70
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:47,505
So with our example Pull when we have when
Smith we could

71
00:05:47,505 --> 00:05:52,945
write out some text to the screen and then
we could introduce another case statement.

72
00:05:56,057 --> 00:06:02,461
And we can choose to have a case statement
on another field, include the when.

73
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:12,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

74
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:40,670
[SOUND] Just like so.

75
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:41,296
Oops.

76
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:46,253
I do apologize.

77
00:06:46,253 --> 00:06:47,628
That's better.

78
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:51,557
So there you can see a nasty case
statement within the original case

79
00:06:51,557 --> 00:06:52,340
statement.
