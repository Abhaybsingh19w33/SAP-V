1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,230
So again, go to Utilities.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,360
You create entries.

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,110
Let's add a new record.

4
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:21,751
Put in the surname, and the forename.

5
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:31,806
[BLANK_AUDIO]

6
00:00:31,806 --> 00:00:37,065
And some initials, gender female, we'll
have a salary of one, two,

7
00:00:37,065 --> 00:00:42,589
three, four, five, and then we enter the
currency key now at the moment,

8
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:47,150
you'll see there's no drop-down or
anything like that, so

9
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:52,268
you don't really know what we need to put
in this currency key field.

10
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:57,632
For now, I will put GBP, because I know
that's gonna be a proper entry.

11
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:00,215
But what we'll do is save the record,

12
00:01:00,215 --> 00:01:05,221
then we'll go back to the design of our
table and we'll build in some error

13
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:11,170
checking to ensure that we do enter
correct currency values in this field.

14
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,288
And also what'd be useful is on the
gender, let's do an example where

15
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:22,472
we can introduce a drop-down box so we can
only choose two values, male and female.

16
00:01:22,472 --> 00:01:28,200
Why don't you save, and step back, and
we'll do just that.

17
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,030
So to enable us to build in error
checking,

18
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,130
we need to what are called foreign keys.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,940
And we'll use foreign keys to ensure the
use can only enter valid values.

20
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,480
So what we'll do is use some forward
navigation,

21
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,210
and we'll take a look at the value table
used for our currency field.

22
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:54,770
So we'll double click.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:06,040
And under the Data Types tab, we can see
this data element

24
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,260
refers to a standard SAP delivered domain,
WAERS.

25
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,750
Let's take a look at this domain.

26
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,070
So we use forward navigation again.

27
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,860
We can see use of time currency key.

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,350
Number of characters five.

29
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,330
And we go to the value range town and

30
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:30,730
look down at the bottom, we can see we
have a value table.

31
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,520
We have covered the value range tab before
when we created our table, but

32
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,560
as a reminder, we can use a value table to
determine the entries

33
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,100
we can make in the field within our table
that is based on this domain.

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,350
So let's use some forward navigation to
look at this table.

35
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,850
Here we can see what the table is made up
of.

36
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,660
We've got six fields.

37
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:05,310
We've got the standard client, currency
key, our currency code.

38
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:10,110
And then some other fields let's take a
browse at the actual data.

39
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:16,554
And if we scroll down, here we go.

40
00:03:16,554 --> 00:03:18,309
So this record right here.

41
00:03:18,309 --> 00:03:24,427
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:27,830
That's the value I entered into our table,
GBP.

43
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:34,076
So I know it's going to be valid, but we
can make use of this check table or this

44
00:03:34,076 --> 00:03:39,600
value range table, to ensure we allow the
user to only pick values from this table.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,445
So let's step back.

46
00:03:41,445 --> 00:03:50,082
[BLANK_AUDIO]

47
00:03:50,082 --> 00:03:51,139
And we'll step back again.

48
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:57,303
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,850
And now we're back to our table.

50
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:06,860
So, what we need to do is go back to our
fields tab, highlight

51
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:12,652
our currency field, and then we're gonna
define a foreign key.

52
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,038
[SOUND] So we'll click the foreign key
button.

53
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:19,812
[SOUND] And we'll get asked if we want to
create it.

54
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:20,996
We'll choose yes.

55
00:04:20,996 --> 00:04:26,626
[SOUND] Now we're being displayed this
create foreign key screen.

56
00:04:26,626 --> 00:04:33,941
So what we'll do is key in some short text
and

57
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:39,290
we get the option of two fields.

58
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:46,560
Now, these two fields are the two key
fields from the TCURC currency table.

59
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,571
And from our table we do have the option
of ensuring that this

60
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:57,571
foreign key matches both fields so that
when we allow the user

61
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:02,669
to select an entry records that returned
will only be valid for

62
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,536
the client that we are working in.

63
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:10,673
But in our case we won't choose this
client field to be part of the key,

64
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:14,084
we'll just choose our W-A-E-R-S field.

65
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:20,715
So all we're gonna do is click this
generic option and

66
00:05:20,715 --> 00:05:24,260
we can wipe out these just for clarity so

67
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,322
then this foreign key will just use our
currency field.

68
00:05:29,322 --> 00:05:31,864
Much indeed W-A-E-R-S field.

69
00:05:31,864 --> 00:05:34,610
In the [UNKNOWN] table.

70
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,930
All we need to do is click on copy and now
our foreign key has been created.

71
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:43,035
So let's activate our table.

72
00:05:43,035 --> 00:05:48,293
[SOUND] And let's go and have a look at

73
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:55,315
the data you can see our last record in
row four.

74
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:59,290
I'm gonna place my cursor on the currency
key field.

75
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,545
I can press the F4 key and now we're
displayed with

76
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:06,765
with the drop-down box of all valid
entries that can go in there.

77
00:06:07,975 --> 00:06:11,785
Now we have just chosen to display the
data in our table.

78
00:06:12,935 --> 00:06:14,855
Therefore, we've got no entry box here.

79
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:21,915
It's only display only, but the drop-down
still works to show us the valid values.

80
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:25,135
If we went back to create a record or
change a record,

81
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:30,960
let's choose change now when we go to

82
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,260
the currency key field we can see that we
have the drop-down button that's appeared.

83
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,860
We can click it.

84
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,170
And choose an appropriate currency.

85
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,020
So let's go down and choose, $US.

86
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,030
And we can see it brings the value back,
and we can click save.

87
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,870
So our currency key has been saved in $US.

88
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,980
Let's go back.
