1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:06,595
In this module, we're going to take a look
at how we can change the transparent

2
00:00:06,595 --> 00:00:10,650
tables that we created
earlier on in the course.

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,100
It's important you know how to do this and
the implications of adding and

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,890
taking away fields to the underlying
data in your database table.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:28,140
So as a reminder, let's take a look at
the table we created called zemployees.

6
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,980
So in the SAP GUI, we can choose
transaction SE11, or under the tools menu,

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,930
ABAP Workbench and then Development,
you've got the ABAP Dictionary transaction

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,300
there in case you forget
the transaction code.

9
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:48,286
So, here it's already entered
the table name for me.

10
00:00:48,286 --> 00:00:51,440
I'll choose display, and

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,680
we can see the six fields that
we entered to create our table.

12
00:00:55,742 --> 00:01:01,580
Remember MANDT is the client field that is
automatically maintained by the system.

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,718
And then we have employee
which is our employee number,

14
00:01:07,718 --> 00:01:12,161
our surname, forename,
title, and date of birth.

15
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:15,686
Now it's important to realize
that whenever you want to change

16
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:18,544
a database table,
you run the risk of losing data,

17
00:01:18,544 --> 00:01:23,070
especially when you're affecting
the key fields in your table.

18
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:27,290
The database system itself will try and
determine if you can make adjustments

19
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,830
by deleting and creating new items which
change the underlying database catalog.

20
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:36,590
Or whether you have to re-implement
what you have already defined.

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,360
Quite often with large tables, you have
to manage the manipulation of the data

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,210
yourself so as to be sure
that you don't lose the data.

23
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:51,580
When your tasks involve just deleting
fields, it's quite a simple task.

24
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,030
But, depending on the table structure and

25
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,950
the contents,
this also has certain complications.

26
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,380
So, before you start any of
these database change tasks,

27
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,550
it's a good idea to mitigate against
as many risks as possible and

28
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,830
start by using a copy
of your database table.

29
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:15,977
This will allow you to test out any
change activities you want to make

30
00:02:15,977 --> 00:02:21,687
without the risk of affecting the original
table and the underlying data.

31
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:27,050
And when you copy a database table,
you only copy the table structure itself.

32
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:31,760
This means just the table properties,
the fields, not the actual data.

33
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,670
So let's have a look at
how we can copy our table.

34
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,170
So we will step back,
back to our initial SE 11 screen.

35
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,741
We already have our table name,
ZEmployees, which we will copy.

36
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:54,548
Now all we need to do is go to
the Copy button, which is Ctrl+F5.

37
00:02:57,545 --> 00:03:01,180
And decide on the table name
that we want to copy to.

38
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,396
So let's be very original and
stick a number 2 on the end.

39
00:03:08,564 --> 00:03:12,399
Click the green tick for the okay,
and as normal, we'll be asked for

40
00:03:12,399 --> 00:03:14,555
a development class.

41
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:18,524
And as in the last modules,
what we will choose is local object.

42
00:03:23,062 --> 00:03:24,090
That's all there is to it.

43
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:26,095
You've now got a copy of the table.

44
00:03:27,335 --> 00:03:30,635
So we have ZEMPLOYEES2 in
our database table there.

45
00:03:30,635 --> 00:03:32,375
We can choose Display.

46
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:36,850
And we can see an exact
copy of the original table.

47
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:44,101
Now one thing to note is that even though
we've copied a table, we can't use it yet,

48
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:47,114
because if you have a look at the status,
it says new.

49
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:50,135
We need to activate our program.

50
00:03:50,135 --> 00:03:51,450
So we'll click the Change button.

51
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,850
And then we'll click the Activate button.

52
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,680
Now remember, or table uses data elements,

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,000
which use data domains that we've
already set up in the previous module.

54
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,840
So all of those objects
are already active.

55
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,740
And when we activate our table,

56
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:17,440
all it needs to do is just activate the
table itself, no other objects behind it.

57
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,120
So now we can take a look at the table and
if you remember, I've said,

58
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,110
all we do is copy the table structure,
not the contents.

59
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,286
So if we look at the table contents.

60
00:04:31,482 --> 00:04:34,624
We can see that we've got
no records in the table.

61
00:04:37,666 --> 00:04:42,413
So what we will do now is enter some
records into our table so that later on,

62
00:04:42,413 --> 00:04:45,477
when we try and add fields and
take fields away,

63
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:49,691
we will see various warning signs
coming up from the system to tell

64
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:54,390
us we may be about to delete data and
it will be unrecoverable.

65
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,152
So, let's go ahead just choose the, sorry,

66
00:04:59,152 --> 00:05:05,256
we'll step back,
then we'll choose the Utilities menu,

67
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:09,301
Table contents, and Create entries.

68
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:11,150
So now you should be
familiar with this screen.

69
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,614
We can just create a number of employees.

70
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:18,296
Super original.

71
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,431
Let's do the drop-down box for
the date of birth.

72
00:05:33,818 --> 00:05:35,909
Just so I get the format correct.

73
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:43,849
And save our record.

74
00:05:54,656 --> 00:05:59,539
Okay, so now we've entered three records
and that should be enough to then allow us

75
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,190
to change the database and
see what effects it has on the data.

76
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:08,876
So just to make sure everything's
been entered correctly,

77
00:06:08,876 --> 00:06:13,286
we'll just choose the Contents view,
and click Number of entries.

78
00:06:13,286 --> 00:06:17,760
We have three, and we can execute and
have a look at the contents.

79
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,358
So let's step back and
go to the table design.

80
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:31,887
And what we're gonna do is add a brand new
field, and we'll make it a non-key field.

81
00:06:31,887 --> 00:06:36,310
And this is the same process that we went
through when we added fields originally.

82
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,757
So let's have a field called initials.

83
00:06:52,355 --> 00:06:59,190
And remember to use the Z, and
remember this is a brand new data element.

84
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,146
So I will double-click and
use forward navigation to generate it.

85
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:18,349
And for the domain, let's see if
there's an existing one called Char3.

86
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:19,884
And there is.

87
00:07:19,884 --> 00:07:22,746
Character field length three.

88
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,489
So we can use that one.

89
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:37,079
There are our field labels, and
we'll activate that data element.

90
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:39,995
Local objects.

91
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,900
There we go,
that data element's now active.

92
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,990
So now when we step back to the table
we can see it's brought through

93
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,130
the field title and
the actual data type of the field.

94
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,575
Let's add another field,
this time called gender.

95
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:08,145
And no prizes to guess what we're
gonna call the data elements.

96
00:08:11,268 --> 00:08:13,880
We can see the data element doesn't exist.

97
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:18,852
So forward navigation,
Yes to save the table,

98
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:22,219
Yes to create the data element.

99
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:26,197
I'll give it a name and
just copy it to the clipboard for

100
00:08:26,197 --> 00:08:28,196
when we do the field label.

101
00:08:28,196 --> 00:08:32,445
And here we'll just make it Char01, and

102
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,939
we can see it already exists,
which is fine.

103
00:08:45,577 --> 00:08:51,381
Activate the object, then we'll step back.

104
00:08:51,381 --> 00:08:53,054
And we have the field.

105
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:58,824
Let's have another one called salary.

106
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,381
ZSalary.

107
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:09,921
Double-click.

108
00:09:12,975 --> 00:09:14,522
You know the drill.

109
00:09:22,357 --> 00:09:27,836
Now this one is going to be
a currency field cuz it's salary.

110
00:09:27,836 --> 00:09:30,634
So what we're gonna choo, do,

111
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:36,243
is choose a currency field called Curi9,
I think that exists.

112
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,405
Yeah, there we go.

113
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,731
And this is a currency field,

114
00:09:40,731 --> 00:09:45,484
we can see it's got a length of
nine with two decimal places.

115
00:09:45,484 --> 00:09:50,140
You can create your own, or
search in the the data dictionary and

116
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,640
use a different one if you like.

117
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,065
But I know this one exists and
I've used it before.

118
00:09:57,065 --> 00:09:58,727
Go to Field label.

119
00:10:06,285 --> 00:10:07,573
Local object.

120
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:14,189
Activate it, and step back.

121
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:20,978
Now, one important thing with the,
salary field is, because it's a currency,

122
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:25,721
we actually need to include
a separate currency field that is

123
00:10:25,721 --> 00:10:30,751
attached to ZSalary to indicate
what currency the salary is in.

124
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:36,882
So I'm from the UK, so this, for me,
would be, GBP, Great British Pounds.

125
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:39,366
If you're in the US, it'd be US Dollars.

126
00:10:39,366 --> 00:10:40,666
So to do that.

127
00:10:43,326 --> 00:10:45,669
Let's create a brand new co,
I'll tell you what we'll do.

128
00:10:45,669 --> 00:10:49,662
First of all, I'll show you
the error message, if we try and

129
00:10:49,662 --> 00:10:53,750
activate the table without
a corresponding currency field.

130
00:10:57,071 --> 00:10:58,661
Here we go, errors occurred.

131
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:02,888
Let's have a look.

132
00:11:02,888 --> 00:11:06,574
So what this is saying is
we need a reference field,

133
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:10,189
a reference table,
to hold the type of currency.

134
00:11:10,189 --> 00:11:11,919
So let's step back and do that.

135
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:20,264
Let's call it ECurrency.

136
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:24,500
And the actual data elements,
we will use one that already exists,

137
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,660
because currency fields, there should
be no need to create your own,

138
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,540
because they should already
exist in the system.

139
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,883
And I know there's one called curcy.

140
00:11:34,883 --> 00:11:38,476
I'll use that and press Enter.

141
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:45,823
And there we can see, it's a Currency Key
field with the length of five.

142
00:11:45,823 --> 00:11:51,189
Now that's all well and good, but
what we need to do next is tell

143
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:57,590
the system that our salary field is
going to reference our currency field.

144
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,253
So this brings us onto this currency tab.

145
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:09,320
And when we flip to it, we can see that
because we are using field type currency,

146
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,722
this field is now available for
us to fill in.

147
00:12:15,185 --> 00:12:19,520
And what we will do is enter
our currency field in there.

148
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,660
And we just need to put
