1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,380
The next thing we want to look at are
include structures.

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,530
Now include structures are very similar to
append structures, but

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,430
the main difference is that include
structures are reuseable objects.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,640
And can be linked to many other tables,

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,130
ABAP programs, dialogue programs, and
structures.

6
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,500
There are a few things you need to keep in
mind though with include structures.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,740
And that is include structures must be
flat structures,

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,880
meaning they cannot contain any additional
structures within them.

9
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,260
And the fields within an include structure

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,950
can have a maximum length of 16
characters.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,110
Let's dive straight in and

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:48,330
see how we create include structures that
get attached to our employee table.

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,740
So whereas we had an append structure
button that we used for

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,970
append structures, we don't have an
include structure button.

15
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,240
So the first thing we need to do is make
sure we are in change mode.

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,710
Oh, one little thing.

17
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know if you noticed but because
we're in display mode here,

18
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,910
when we appended our append structure from
the previous video,

19
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,900
all we saw was this one append line.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,490
We didn't see the actual field within the
append structure.

21
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:23,680
This is some quirk within SAP that when
you're in display mode,

22
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,040
you can see the field, but when you switch
back to change mode, it disappears.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,860
Don't ask me the logic, I don't know why.

24
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,870
So anyway, what we want to do is create
our include.

25
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,180
And before we do it, just a quick note
that it's

26
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,670
important where you place your cursor when
we do this.

27
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,590
Because wherever your place your cursor on
your table,

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,370
the include will be inserted one row
above.

29
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,670
So if we add our cursor here on surname.

30
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,535
The include, would be between surname and
the employee field.

31
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:03,503
[SOUND] So why is that important?

32
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:08,169
Well if you wanted your include structure
to be part of the table key,

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:12,540
you have to make sure it appears at the
top of the table.

34
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,800
Because all table fields used as a table
key

35
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,090
need to be grouped together at the top of
your table.

36
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,610
But in our case, let's just insert it
above our append structure.

37
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,440
So I'm gonna place my cursor on the append
structure row,

38
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,770
then go to the edit menu, and then include
insert.

39
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,350
And remembering to use our customer name
space, we use Zed, and

40
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:49,435
we'll call this Z-E-M-P L for good luck.

41
00:02:49,435 --> 00:02:54,325
Click the green continue tick and then we
get a warning message

42
00:02:54,325 --> 00:02:57,675
just saying it's not active, well we know
that because we're just creating it.

43
00:02:59,905 --> 00:03:00,885
And the green tick again.

44
00:03:02,025 --> 00:03:07,514
And then we can see your include structure
has been inserted between the append and

45
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,411
the e-currency field.

46
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,526
So now let's go out to field to our
enclosed structure.

47
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:18,080
Let's just double-click it, use forward
navigation,

48
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,220
and we'll choose yes to save our table.

49
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,250
Yes to create the structure.

50
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,180
And then we have a screen very similar to
the append structure.

51
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,830
So just like before, let's key in a short
text,

52
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,700
and then we'll create individual fields.

53
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,210
Let's just create one field, and let's
call this location.

54
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,402
[SOUND] Oh.
I forgot, remember customer names based

55
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:57,860
on, we'll use ZZ to indicate it's not part
of our original table.

56
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,970
And we'll use ZLOCAT for the component.

57
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:07,462
And we'll use the forward navigation to
create the data element.

58
00:04:07,462 --> 00:04:17,462
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:04:19,046 --> 00:04:24,253
And again we'll keep it very simple and
use a ten character field.

60
00:04:24,253 --> 00:04:34,253
[BLANK_AUDIO]

61
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,700
So there we have our field added to the
include.

62
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,030
Let's activate the include, then step back
to our table.

63
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,720
And there we can see our include is set
there just above the append structure.

64
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,140
Our table is inactive, so once again,

65
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,750
activate our table and now we're good to
go.

66
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:04,920
We can use it however we wish.

67
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,860
So let's just view the table, view the
contents,

68
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:11,550
and hopefully we'll see the additional
field.

69
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,660
Here we go, inserted before the field in
our append structure.

70
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,860
And as you can see, it looks just like any
other field, and can be treated as so.

71
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,620
So what we'll do, let's edit a few records
just so we've got some data in there.

72
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,680
Department IT, of course.

73
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,360
Save the record.
Another one.

74
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,385
Hurries its time HR department.

75
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:53,430
Oh, I did say I was gonna use codes,
didn't I?

76
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,130
Nevermind lets stick with this [LAUGH] as
long as

77
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,032
we keep it below ten characters we'll be
fine.

78
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:06,545
So we scroll along we, there we can see
the data has been added to each record.

79
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:09,545
[BLANK_AUDIO]

80
00:06:09,545 --> 00:06:12,503
And if I flip back and just go to display
mode,

81
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:16,003
[BLANK_AUDIO]

82
00:06:16,003 --> 00:06:19,711
[SOUND] Sorry come back out and then go
into display.

83
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:24,617
There we can see the fields in a different
color, location which is

84
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:29,620
part of the include, and department part
of the append structure.

85
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,890
And as I've just done that, I've just
remembered one thing.

86
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,840
I've told you that there's this anomaly
with the fields for

87
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,340
the include and the append.

88
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,850
Not displaying in change view.

89
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:49,800
I seem to remember if you click on the row
with your include,

90
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,980
and then come up to the expand include
button, there we go, it shows it.

91
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:01,660
Shows you how long it is since I've
[LAUGH] I've used a, and

92
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,640
the same with the append structure.

93
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,800
Still, its a little strange why they don't
expand them by default, but there we go
