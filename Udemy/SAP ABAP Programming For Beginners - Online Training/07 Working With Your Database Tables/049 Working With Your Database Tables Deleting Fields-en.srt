1
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:06,430
Let's now take a look at deleting fields
from your table.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,430
It doesn't happen very often,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:13,330
but there may be instances where you need
to remove a field from a table.

4
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,730
And when you do this,

5
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,960
you must take special care, because you
run the risk of losing data.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,960
So first of all, we've been looking at Key
Field.

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,700
So, if we start with those, and

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:29,320
you'll probably know that if we remove a
Key Field from our

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,050
table that contains data, it is more than
likely you'll end up losing records.

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,350
Because, the fields that make up your
table key, make each record unique.

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,070
Taking away a field from the key, can
result in non-unique records.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,170
So, once the table is adjusted, some
records will be deleted.

13
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,540
SAP systems are very, very large systems,
and

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:59,525
tables are used all over the system for
various needs.

15
00:01:00,565 --> 00:01:04,665
We've already seen how we can use the
Currency Check Table,

16
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:09,415
to bring up a list of values that we use
to enter data into our Employees Table.

17
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:15,240
Well, if that table was removed, then our
drop down would no longer work.

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,740
And it will highly likely inactivate our
table,

19
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:22,410
because our table uses components of that
currency table.

20
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:26,470
So, whenever you're working with a table,
and

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:31,830
you're thinking of deleting fields, keep
in mind, ask yourself some questions.

22
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:37,260
I this table being used as a check table,
for some other tables in this system?

23
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,820
And if so, how's it going to affect those
tables?

24
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,200
Now, if you do try and

25
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,260
delete fields from your table that are
being used elsewhere in the system,

26
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,060
your SAP system itself should stop you
from actually making the deletion.

27
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,440
Or at least give you a warning.

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,010
But, don't rely on that, always check
yourself.

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,870
And one final thing to remember is that if
you delete fields from your table,

30
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:09,718
you need to remember to convert your table
using the SE-14 transaction.

31
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:17,880
The Table Utilities so that the data is
adjusted and the table is made active.

32
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,080
So, let's go through an example of how we
delete fields, and

33
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,971
we will use the Z Employees2 Table.

34
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:31,396
So, I will go into Change mode, and first
of all I'll just create a field,

35
00:02:31,396 --> 00:02:35,444
I will insert a field before this Include.

36
00:02:35,444 --> 00:02:38,658
[BLANK_AUDIO]

37
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:43,220
And let's call it zawesome.

38
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,460
Don't worry, we're gonna delete this one.

39
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:50,090
And let's just use a data element, that
we've already set up.

40
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,769
Let's use that title and press Enter.

41
00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:00,150
And you can see it brings across the the
Title attributes.

42
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,622
We'll Activate the table.

43
00:03:01,622 --> 00:03:04,873
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:03:04,873 --> 00:03:07,148
And then we'll go and enter some data.

45
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:17,148
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:21,950
So, let's start in the the 10 number
range.

47
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:30,059
And I'm just going to key in any old
gibberish here.

48
00:03:30,059 --> 00:03:40,059
[BLANK_AUDIO]

49
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,549
And click Save.

50
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,453
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:04:00,453 --> 00:04:03,470
So I'll come back out.

52
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,470
And we'll just have a view of the table,

53
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,770
to make sure the record has been added
successfully.

54
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,530
And there it is, and we can see the data
we entered into the record.

55
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,070
That looks fine.

56
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,170
So now to delete this, we'll click on the
Field,

57
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:28,670
click the Delete button, and then we will
Activate the table.

58
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,720
So, as you can see the system is
displaying an error,

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,620
which we'll take a look at.

60
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,822
Is telling us the table was not activated,

61
00:04:43,822 --> 00:04:47,662
because we deleted the z_awesome field.

62
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:54,269
So, as I said before, we have to go to
transaction SE-14 and

63
00:04:54,269 --> 00:05:01,268
adjust the table and this will have the
result of losing some data.

64
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:04,724
So utilities, database utilities.

65
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:07,753
[BLANK_AUDIO]

66
00:05:07,753 --> 00:05:14,254
Going to process it in the foreground, and
we will activate and adjust the database.

67
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:19,966
[BLANK_AUDIO]

68
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:26,421
That's done successfully, so back to the
table where we'll view our data.

69
00:05:26,421 --> 00:05:29,184
There's our record.

70
00:05:29,184 --> 00:05:32,821
And as we can see, our field has been
removed, and

71
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:35,685
we have lost that data from that field.

72
00:05:35,685 --> 00:05:42,140
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,800
Now, let's see what happens when we delete
a Key Field?

74
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,820
And to do this, I'm going to duplicate
this table.

75
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,885
Just so that we don't affect the current
one, and don't lose all the records.

76
00:05:58,885 --> 00:06:00,370
[BLANK_AUDIO]

77
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:02,070
So, we'll create a New Table.

78
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,880
Give this a fix of three.

79
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,860
It's new so

80
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:15,070
we need to activate it, and the table
should be empty, which it is.

81
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,694
You can also press this number of entries,
and

82
00:06:22,694 --> 00:06:28,420
it'll bring up a dialogue box telling you
there's no records.

83
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,378
So, let's go and enter some records.

84
00:06:30,378 --> 00:06:36,078
[BLANK_AUDIO]
Oh, actually,

85
00:06:36,078 --> 00:06:44,120
I'm jumping the gun.

86
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:51,490
Let's go add another field to the Table
Key.

87
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,826
So, what we will do, is make Surname a key
field.

88
00:06:53,826 --> 00:07:02,130
Come into Change mode.

89
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,480
Make it a key field, activate.

90
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,860
And, remember, we've got no records in the
table now, so

91
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,810
it's activated successfully, no problem.

92
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,886
And now we will go in and enter some
records.

93
00:07:11,886 --> 00:07:21,886
[BLANK_AUDIO]

94
00:07:23,031 --> 00:07:27,040
Click Save.
And now, just to do this nice and quick,

95
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:33,339
I'm just gonna overwrite, keeping the same
sort of data here.

96
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,020
We will keep the Surname Smith.

97
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,700
Tell you what, let's do it this way.

98
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:44,000
We will keep Employee Number 1.

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,800
But because Surname is part of the key,

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:52,260
all we need to do is make this unique, for
us to have a unique record in the table.

101
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:56,070
So, we will create Smith 2 and leave
everything else as it is.

102
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,200
New Employee Number 2 suffix.

103
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,230
The Surname as Andrews.

104
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:18,380
Save on as this.

105
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:20,465
Same thing, leave it as 2.

106
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,275
And we'll do Andrews 2.

107
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:28,970
Entirely different with a dash.

108
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,510
And click Save.

109
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,300
So, I'll come back out.

110
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,910
Then we'll view the data.

111
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,675
So, we have four records, Smith, Smith-2,
Andrews, Andrews-2.

112
00:08:36,675 --> 00:08:43,895
And we can see our Smiths have the same
employee number, and so do the Andrews.

113
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:49,275
So now, what we will do is remove the
Surname field,

114
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:54,065
and we will see what effect that has on
our data?

115
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,390
Because by removing the Surname field, the
only unique key we have is the Clients and

116
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:07,544
Employee Number, and that would leave us
with duplicate records,

117
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:11,779
which is not allowed.

118
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:17,010
So back to the table, let's delete the
field.

119
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,975
I will activate it, and we should be
showing some errors.

120
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:23,760
[BLANK_AUDIO]

121
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,126
And we can see the system is just telling
us, the table is not active,

122
00:09:28,126 --> 00:09:30,930
because we have removed the Surname field.

123
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:37,301
So we will go to the Utilities,

124
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:42,692
and choose to Activate and

125
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:47,355
Adjust the Database.

126
00:09:47,355 --> 00:09:48,957
That's been done successfully.

127
00:09:48,957 --> 00:09:53,415
So, now what do you think the effect is on
the table?

128
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:56,550
Let's have a look.

129
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,571
So there you go.

130
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:58,779
You can see.

131
00:09:58,779 --> 00:10:03,614
The system has actually removed two of the
records, because we would have been

132
00:10:03,614 --> 00:10:07,286
left with duplicate records, according to
the table key.

133
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:11,810
And the system has kept the first record
that it encountered.

134
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,998
The second record has been deleted.

135
00:10:14,998 --> 00:10:19,781
[BLANK_AUDIO]

136
00:10:19,781 --> 00:10:25,285
So just to summarize, be very, very
careful when deleting fields both, because

137
00:10:25,285 --> 00:10:31,350
you can lose data and your table and
fields could be used as reference fields.

138
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,240
And check tables for other database tables
in your SAP system.
