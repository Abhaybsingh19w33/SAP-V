1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:08,450
Now I want to discuss key fields in a
little more detail.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:14,170
If we want to add fields or take fields
away that are key fields, then we need to

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:19,630
take into consideration exactly what will
be going on in the database itself.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
Up to now we have added fields to the
table included depend structures and

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,140
include structures.

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,030
But the system actually applies these
changes to the ABAP dictionary,

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:33,060
not the underlying database.

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,660
When we adjust any key fields the system

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,630
has to apply changes to the underlying
database itself.

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,200
And you need to think about this.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,920
If you've got data in your table and
you're changing key fields,

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,500
who knows what effect it can have.

13
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,290
If you're introducing a new key field and
it probably won't have a massive effect.

14
00:00:55,290 --> 00:01:02,370
It will probably still allow you to at the
field, activate it, so you can go in and

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,270
add new data to the new field ensuring
that your records stay unique.

16
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,370
If you try and change a field from being a
key field to not a key field

17
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,190
then you need to put your thinking cap on.

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:20,498
Because if you've got lots of data in the
underlying database, by taking away a key

19
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:26,680
field, it could mean that you introduce
duplicate records into your table

20
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,330
because now your table key is not as
unique as before.

21
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,130
You could end up with some undesired
effects, such as corrupt data, or

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:39,840
records being deleted from your table.

23
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:46,560
Let's dive in and have a look at how we
can introduce new fields and

24
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,300
take fields away, change fields, and that
sort of thing.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,510
So you can see we've got the employee's
table here that we've been working with.

26
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,900
And what we will do is turn our surname
field into a key field.

27
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,290
And it's quite simple.

28
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,130
We just click the little tick to say it's
a key field.

29
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,380
And we might as well click the initial
values field as well.

30
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,045
And then we just need to activate.

31
00:02:14,045 --> 00:02:19,934
[SOUND] It's activated fine.

32
00:02:19,934 --> 00:02:22,221
We can view our data

33
00:02:22,221 --> 00:02:23,287
[BLANK_AUDIO]

34
00:02:23,287 --> 00:02:28,478
[SOUND] And now you see the changing color
for surname, indicating it's a key field.

35
00:02:28,478 --> 00:02:32,621
All our records are still the same, we
know they're unique,

36
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,701
so nothing much has happened.

37
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:41,159
[SOUND] But now, let's take away this key
field.

38
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:45,440
We'll still keep it in the table, but
we'll say it's not part of the key.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,920
Now the system doesn't know what records
are in the table right now, so

40
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,330
when we try to activate it, we should get
some error messages warning us that,

41
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,620
hey, you're removing a field that was part
of the key, and

42
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,310
you could have some, you know, undesired
effects happening to the data.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,050
So we'll activate, and truly know if we
got an error message

44
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,190
indicating that the old key had surname in
it, but now it doesn't.

45
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:21,160
And this is, this is not just a warning,
you know, it's an error.

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,150
It's telling us No, I'm not gonna activate
the table for

47
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,730
you because you may lose some data.

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,070
So how do we get around this?

49
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:33,360
We know that the data in our table is
actually gonna be okay.

50
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:38,700
So we want to allow this but you know, the
tool's saying we can't.

51
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,880
And that's why we need to open up a
different transaction.

52
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,720
So we can either open up a new session, or

53
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,066
go direct to the transaction we want,
which is SE14 from this screen.

54
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:53,031
Let's do that.

55
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,970
Utilities, then choose database utility.

56
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,740
When this screen appears, just keep in
mind that in a production environment,

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:07,690
you may be dealing with a table with
millions of records, and

58
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,410
you wouldn't want to execute this
transaction on a table of that size with

59
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:14,470
a processing time of direct,

60
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,300
which means it's going to run while your
screen is, is present right now.

61
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,630
It'd be best to run this program in the
background.

62
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,670
But for us, we know our table is super
small, so we can just

63
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:31,150
run the process in the foreground and it
should get done within seconds.

64
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:37,710
So all we need to do is click the Activate
and adjust database with save data.

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,980
Request adjust, we'll choose Yes.

66
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,310
And there we can see it's run
successfully.

67
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:53,390
So now if we step back our table has now
been activated.

68
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,280
We can view our data and

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:03,770
our surname field is back to how it was
before we made it a key field.

70
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,990
So that's it for key fields, really.

71
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:10,230
There's just one more thing I forgot to
mention, and that's these buttons up here.

72
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,670
If you did want to insert a new field as
part of your table key,

73
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:20,160
then you need to be able to adjust the
location of the fields on the screen.

74
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,560
So, let's say we wanted to insert a new
field above the surname field.

75
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:31,340
We would highlight the surname field and
then choose the insert button.

76
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:33,210
It moves everything down one, and we can
add our new field.

77
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:37,730
I'll remove it.

78
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,480
Let's say we wanted to move title as part
of the key, we can highlight it.

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,283
And then we have the cut, copy, and paste
buttons up here, so I can just use cut and

80
00:05:49,283 --> 00:05:53,490
then paste.

81
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,830
You get the idea and that's it for table
keys.

82
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,390
Just so I don't screw this table up.

83
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:01,920
Let me exit out without saving.

84
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:05,480
Now go back in just to make sure
everything is good.

85
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,330
Yeah it's back how it was all active
