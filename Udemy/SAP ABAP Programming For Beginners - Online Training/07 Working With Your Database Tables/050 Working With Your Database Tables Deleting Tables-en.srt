1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,080
Now we're going to take a look at deleting
complete database tables themselves.

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,490
I mentioned when we covered deleting
fields that you don't often have to do

3
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:17,065
that task, and when we talk about deleting
tables, but that's even more infrequent.

4
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:22,125
But you may have this requirement so let's
go through it so

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,545
we can understand the process.

6
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:25,755
First thing is,

7
00:00:25,755 --> 00:00:30,790
you will only be allowed to delete your
own customer-specific tables.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:33,980
You will not be allowed to delete SAP
delivered tables.

9
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:39,690
Now because we have just created this
ZEMPLOYEES3 table,

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:43,740
we will use this in our example for
deleting the table.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,470
But before that I just want to show you a
technique for checking that everything is

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,890
okay for you to delete the table, and you
will not affect other parts of the system.

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:59,810
So what I'm gonna do is go back to our
ZEMPLOYEES1 table.

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:07,550
Because we have included this table in the
ABAP programs we have created so far.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:13,300
So what I have done, I've keyed in
ZEMPLOYEES1, I'll choose Display.

16
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,800
No.

17
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,390
it looks like, that's the wrong one, must
be ZEMPLOYEES.

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,540
There we go, and we'll step back.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,777
And now what I'm gonna do, is go to this
button up here, the Where-Used button.

20
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,490
Now this is really, really handy tool,
that you will become familiar with, and

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,670
you will use an awful lot whilst you are
developing, testing,

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:38,710
and just reading ABAP programs.

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:44,380
So if we click the button, the system then
brings up a dialog box

24
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,710
where we go through and choose the objects
we want to look through.

25
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:53,200
So what this is going to do is check all
the different types of objects that

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,850
we have in our system that we select.

27
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:59,680
For a reference to our table is
ZEMPLOYEES.

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,340
Now, we know we have only used this table
in a program before, but

29
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:07,780
with other tables you may not have that
background knowledge.

30
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:14,023
So you may want to go through, have a look
at objects such as structures,

31
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:19,899
database tables, views, and so on, and to
execute it, just click the green tick.

32
00:02:19,899 --> 00:02:23,044
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:26,560
Get a little pop-up, Where-Used Include,
Fields of the Table.

34
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,750
We just choose Yes.

35
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,170
So the system's going away and checking
all of the different objects

36
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,690
that we have selected to find references
to our table.

37
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,000
And there it's come back and

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,180
it's shown us, we have two programs that
are using this table.

39
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,060
So immediately we know that if we delete
this table

40
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,720
these programs are gonna become inactive.

41
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,040
They're not going to work anymore.

42
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,180
If you want to look at the specific code
in the table,

43
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,515
all you need to do is double-click.

44
00:03:03,478 --> 00:03:07,760
So by double-clicking on this entry it's
then showing the snippets of code

45
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,880
in our program where the table is used.

46
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,530
And we can see we have lots of selects and
write statements.

47
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,437
And once again, we can double-click on any
one of these lines,

48
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:25,656
and actually jump straight into the
program.

49
00:03:25,656 --> 00:03:30,463
There we go, and it takes us to the exact
location that we double-clicked on.

50
00:03:30,463 --> 00:03:38,020
[BLANK_AUDIO]

51
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,980
Program down here.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,630
Exactly the same thing,

53
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,500
we can double-click and go have a look at
the program.

54
00:03:47,578 --> 00:03:50,785
So this Where-Used button is a very useful
tool, and

55
00:03:50,785 --> 00:03:55,364
I suggest you get used to using it,
because it saves you an awful lot of time.

56
00:03:55,364 --> 00:03:57,999
[BLANK_AUDIO]

57
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:02,987
Now, if we try to delete this table now
the system will not let us do

58
00:04:02,987 --> 00:04:06,730
it because we have objects that dependent
on it.

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,060
So what you would have to do is find those
programs, take some course of action to

60
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,810
either edit the code, take out references
to the table or remove the programs

61
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,039
completely before you could then come back
and delete this table.

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,130
So what we will do is change the table
name.

63
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,780
And we'll use the ZEMPLOYEES3 table that
we created in the previous videos.

64
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,985
And we will choose to delete this table.

65
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:43,235
As you can see we're presented with a
message box telling us the table contains

66
00:04:43,235 --> 00:04:47,985
data, and we know this, but we just want
to delete the table anyway.

67
00:04:49,005 --> 00:04:53,530
If you click the green tick button, we
will be taken back to the previous screen,

68
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,830
and the table would not be deleted, but

69
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,960
if you click the little trash can, the
table will get deleted.

70
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,040
And there we have the confirmation message
at the bottom,

71
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,925
saying the table was removed.

72
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:15,130
If we try and display it, we can see it
does not exist.

73
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,450
Now one final note, is that now we've
deleted the table,

74
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,710
we cannot undo this process.

75
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:27,290
The table is gone completely.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:32,600
So before you click that trash can button,
make sure you do want to delete the table.
