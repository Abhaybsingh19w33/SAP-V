1
00:00:02,810 --> 00:00:04,330
So we're taking a look at foreign keys.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,760
Now what i want to do, is discuss what's
called appendix structures.

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:15,460
And in our last example we added some
fields to our table.

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:23,070
We also have the option of using append
structures to add additional fields.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,860
And this is the preferred method of
maintaining SAP delivered tables and

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,750
quite often extending your own customer
specific tables, why would

7
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,540
we use appendix structures rather than
just adding fields to our table?

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,270
Well, if it's a standard SAP table and we
add fields to it.

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,610
What if SAP released a new version of
software,

10
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:49,740
where they add some fields themselves?

11
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,720
Well, when we come to do an upgrade.

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,560
We're gonna have some serious
difficulties.

13
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,800
Because we could have added fields to the
table and

14
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,330
we tried to apply the update we could end
up with some serious errors.

15
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:08,860
Our fields could get overwritten by those
new fields that SAP have added.

16
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,910
You never want to be in that situation.

17
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,170
So to insure you don't come up against
this problem,

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:18,690
this is where append structures are a
great help.

19
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:24,520
Append structures give us a safe way to
enhance our tables and

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,920
standard sub-tables.

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,040
When we use append structures the existing
table remains unchanged

22
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,650
which removes any risk of our changes
being overwritten.

23
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,960
And quite often in an SAP system

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,390
you will see a table having multiple
append structures applied to it

25
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:48,460
because there have been different
development needs as time has gone by and

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,780
people want to add more fields to the
underlying standard sub-table.

27
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:58,080
So let's have a look at append structures,
how we create them how they are used.

28
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:05,140
So as you can see, we are already in
transaction SE11 with our table loaded.

29
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,975
What we need to do is use our mouse and go
to the append structure button.

30
00:02:10,975 --> 00:02:14,186
[SOUND] We'll give it a click and

31
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:19,878
the system is automatically suggesting a
name for us.

32
00:02:19,878 --> 00:02:24,317
And notice it's automatically telling us
to use our customer

33
00:02:24,317 --> 00:02:29,280
name space making sure our pen structure
starts with the letter zed.

34
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,067
Let's accept this choice by the system
[SOUND] and

35
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:41,211
now we're displayed with what looks like
an empty table structure.

36
00:02:41,211 --> 00:02:45,128
So let's go ahead and fill it in just like
we would with a normal table.

37
00:02:45,128 --> 00:02:53,086
[BLANK_AUDIO]

38
00:02:53,086 --> 00:02:54,720
Extra fields for employees.

39
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,510
And when we come down to the body of the
screen,

40
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,280
notice this field now is called component.

41
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,320
And this is just where we create our new
fields.

42
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,020
But one thing to keep in mind, it would be
nice to differentiate our customer fields

43
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:18,940
in our table from our new custom
components in our append structure.

44
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,050
So the best way to do this is still stay
with the customer name space.

45
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,586
But where we'll use Z in the field name,
let's use ZZ.

46
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:32,923
And what we'll do is create a department
field.

47
00:03:32,923 --> 00:03:36,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:42,435
And same thing with component type [SOUND]
use ZZ,

49
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:45,420
i choose yes to create.

50
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:53,129
[SOUND] It's just asking us to save the
append structure which we will do.

51
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:55,461
[BLANK_AUDIO]

52
00:03:55,461 --> 00:03:59,920
It's asking us what type of object we want
to create and it's a data element.

53
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,961
[BLANK_AUDIO]

54
00:04:06,961 --> 00:04:10,670
[SOUND] And let's choose.

55
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:12,670
Should we have a code or description?

56
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,711
Well let's choose 10 character code.

57
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:22,003
Let's say copy this [SOUND] choose a field
label.

58
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:26,170
[SOUND]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

59
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,378
And activate the data element.

60
00:04:28,378 --> 00:04:32,460
[SOUND] [INAUDIBLE]

61
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,961
or step back.

62
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:38,346
Now we're back to our append structure,

63
00:04:38,346 --> 00:04:42,802
is brought through the properties of the
data element and we can activate it.

64
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:49,711
[SOUND] So let's step back and it should
take us back to our table.

65
00:04:49,711 --> 00:04:54,681
And now we have an extra row that shows
the actual append structure we've just

66
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:55,378
created.

67
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,754
[BLANK_AUDIO]

68
00:04:57,754 --> 00:05:01,475
If we want to go back to it, you just
double-click the append structure.

69
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:07,457
[SOUND] So that's a very easy way to add
additional fields to our tables and

70
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:14,336
standard sub-tables without effecting the
structure of the sub-table itself.

71
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:17,428
Now let's take a look at the data within
our table and

72
00:05:17,428 --> 00:05:20,818
have a look at what field the append
structure has added.

73
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:25,545
[SOUND]
[BLANK_AUDIO]

74
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:30,380
[SOUND] If we scroll to the right, you'll
see our brand new department field

75
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:34,461
has been added as though it's just a
normal field in our table.

76
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:38,048
And we can enter data into the field, just
like any other field.

77
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,779
[BLANK_AUDIO]
