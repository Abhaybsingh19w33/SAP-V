[BLANK_AUDIO]

2
00:00:03,541 --> 00:00:08,840
The next statement we'll take a look at,
is the condense statement.

3
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,811
So let me bring these up here.

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:17,711
[BLANK_AUDIO]

5
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:22,384
Our other programs quite often have to
deal with long text fields

6
00:00:22,384 --> 00:00:24,730
that contain unwanted spaces.

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,060
So this is where the condense statement
can be used to

8
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,380
remove these blank characters.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,540
The definition of the condense statement
is very simple.

10
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,350
So first if we start off with typing out
the condense statement,

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,320
we can then have a look.

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:45,310
I'll just search help and see the basic
form.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,880
So here you can see condense and

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,860
the field name, and there's just one
addition we can add, which is the no gaps.

15
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,750
So I'll key in a line of ABAP code and
we'll go through it and

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,140
test the program out and see the output.

17
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:03,950
Okay.
So I've added some coding here.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,570
I just pointed out I put the top in the
data statement.

19
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,610
I've extended the number of fields I've
defined by

20
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,470
creating a new field called space name.

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:15,670
It is 20 characters long.

22
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,830
And you can see I've given it a value of
Mr. Joe Smith.

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,680
And you'll notice I've put many spaces
between the three individual words.

24
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,100
Then coming down I've added a comment just
showing the definition of the content

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,860
statements with the optional no gaps,
which we'll come to in a second.

26
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,073
And then the basic output.

27
00:01:38,073 --> 00:01:42,033
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:01:42,033 --> 00:01:46,687
Now add in, just a bit of code to

29
00:01:46,687 --> 00:01:51,888
write it out to our report window.

30
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,670
And we're done.

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,800
So it's very very simple.

32
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
The condense statement will take out the
blank spaces

33
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,410
between our three words but not fully what
it will do.

34
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,550
It will leave one space between each word.

35
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,180
So we should end up with Mr. space Joe
space Smith.

36
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,740
Let's save the reports.

37
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,080
And test it out.

38
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,170
You can see Mr. Joe Smith with one space.

39
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,306
Now the addition,

40
00:02:25,306 --> 00:02:28,788
[BLANK_AUDIO]

41
00:02:28,788 --> 00:02:33,363
Is no gaps and no doubt you can work out
exactly what this is going to do.

42
00:02:33,363 --> 00:02:39,099
[BLANK_AUDIO]

43
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,098
Let's make it look nice.

44
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:43,640
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:49,044
So this one will do exactly the same, but
where we were left with one space between

46
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:54,465
each word it should then bring everything
together so there are no spaces at all.

47
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,903
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:02:56,903 --> 00:02:58,727
And as you can see.

49
00:02:58,727 --> 00:03:01,260
A very simple statements.

50
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:01,930
Nice and easy to code.
