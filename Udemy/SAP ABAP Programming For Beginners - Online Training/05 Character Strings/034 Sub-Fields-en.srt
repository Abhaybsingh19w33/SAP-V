1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,870
It's now time to have a look at what we
called sub-fields.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:07,280
Now we have the option, within ABAP,

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,870
of referring to specific characters within
a field.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:15,770
This is referred to as processing
sub-fields,

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,790
whereby we reference a specific character
position within the field itself.

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,330
Let's have a look at an example.

7
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,760
And we'll go through it line by line.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,879
So you become familiar with how to use
this.

9
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,848
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,107
So I've added some code here.

11
00:00:32,107 --> 00:00:35,034
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:38,680
And the first section shows we're
declaring three new variables.

13
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,130
International telephone number, country
code and telephone number.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,248
And you can see the different size of each
field.

15
00:00:46,248 --> 00:00:49,685
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:00:49,685 --> 00:00:53,822
And the first line we have, I am assigning
a character string to international

17
00:00:53,822 --> 00:00:58,160
telephone number, write in the results to
the screen, followed by a blank line.

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:02,779
And then we come down to the actual
sub-field processing itself.

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:09,620
So our first line of code shows that we
are filling the country code field

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,640
with the first three characters of the
international telephone number field.

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,470
That's quite straightforward.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,300
Let's have a look at our second line.

23
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,980
In this example, we can see the field
telephone number,

24
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,250
is going to be filled with 13 characters
of the international telephone

25
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,304
number field starting after the fourth
character.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,280
So how we'd write this is telephone number
equals international telephone number

27
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:50,240
plus 4, which means start after the fourth
character,

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,070
open brackets 13 close brackets, which
references 13 characters.

29
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,040
Then we're going to move the output to the
screen.

30
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,090
Then the last example we have Is instead
of just moving specific

31
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:09,530
characters of the international telephone
number field, to telephone number.

32
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:13,806
We're actually going to be updating the
country

33
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:18,490
code sub-fields with the literal 01.

34
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,510
So how we write this is,

35
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:26,440
our country code field +1,

36
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:33,540
which means stat after the first character
and fill the next two characters.

37
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,740
So the country code field is only three
characters in total anyway, so in effect,

38
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:43,695
it's gonna fill the last 2 characters of
this field with the value of 01.

39
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,530
And the last line of the code,

40
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,370
is just going to produce the outputs on
the screen for us to check.

41
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,754
So first of all,

42
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:55,320
let me move this data statement to the top
of the program where it belongs.

43
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:00,987
[BLANK_AUDIO]

44
00:03:00,987 --> 00:03:02,845
Now do the necessary formatting.

45
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:12,845
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:21,260
Have a quick check of the program, make
sure the syntax is correct.

47
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,700
Activate it, and then we'll run the test.

48
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,820
Here we can see the results.

49
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,860
So first of all,

50
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,150
we're outputting the full international
telephone number to the screen.

51
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,710
Then the next field, the country code
field, we filled with

52
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,920
the first three characters of the
international telephone number field.

53
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:47,300
The next one, the actual telephone number,

54
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:52,210
we reference 13 characters after the
fourth character.

55
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:57,020
So the fourth character was the Dutch
sign, so we can see

56
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,705
the next 13 characters starts with the
open brackets and ends with the number 6.

57
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,030
In our last example it updated the country
code field, but as a sub-field.

58
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,600
So it only updated the second and third
character of the field.

59
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,990
So it's quite straightforward.

60
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,580
And you'll see this used a lot in SAP
programs, and you'll probably

61
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,350
find yourself needing to refer to
sub-fields quite often, and

62
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,220
instead of creating brand-new fields,
holding values there, this's often a lot

63
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,930
easier just to use the subfield ten times,
instead of holding additional values.

64
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,027
As a variables in memory.

65
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:44,369
