1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,510
Now moving on.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:05,140
Let's have a look, at finding the length
of a string.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,630
Now to do this, we actually use a function
instead of a statement.

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,530
And this is a very simple function, called
string length.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,830
So, I will add some code, and then we'll
go through the statement,

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:19,320
and output the results.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,750
So the first thing to do, is to declare
the new data field.

8
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:32,660
We'll call it LEN for length, and the data
type of I just to hold the integer

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:37,120
value that will represent the length of
the string you're trying to interrogate.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,890
Then down to the code, we can have the
following three lines,

11
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:54,570
and you'll see it looks very simple, we
have the field we have just defined and

12
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,490
that will contain the length of the
surname field.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,220
And it is this string function, the string
length function,

14
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,600
strlen, that will look at the surname
field,

15
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,060
move the length of the string into the LEN
field we've declared.

16
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:16,540
If we take a quick peek at the surname
field.

17
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:19,300
You can see it currently holds the word
Smith.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,030
Which is five characters in length.

19
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,960
So when we execute this report the LEN
field will contain the number five.

20
00:01:30,955 --> 00:01:35,575
And that will be output at the end of this
write statement.

21
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:42,295
So I've included some text and then the
LEN field at the end.

22
00:01:42,295 --> 00:01:45,265
So let's check the report for syntax
errors.

23
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:47,035
Everything's good.

24
00:01:47,035 --> 00:01:49,035
And we'll execute the report.

25
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,150
And then we have the length of the surname
field is five.

26
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,170
Very simple.
