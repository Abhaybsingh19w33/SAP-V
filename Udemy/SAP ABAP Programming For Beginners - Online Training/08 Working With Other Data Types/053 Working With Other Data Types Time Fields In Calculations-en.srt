1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,030
Let's move onto working with Time Fields.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:08,400
Just like using calculations with Date
Fields,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,340
we can also do the same with Time Fields.

4
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,600
All of the same principles apply, so let's
get straight onto it,

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,760
and look at some examples.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,814
In these examples, we'll look at the
fictitious employee clocking-in and

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,378
clocking-out times.

8
00:00:23,378 --> 00:00:30,583
So, first of all, we're going to declare
the two times, clock-in and clock-out.

9
00:00:30,583 --> 00:00:32,083
[BLANK_AUDIO]

10
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:34,251
So back up to our data section.

11
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:38,544
[BLANK_AUDIO]

12
00:00:38,544 --> 00:00:40,833
Let's create a new little block.

13
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:50,833
[BLANK_AUDIO]

14
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:07,918
Just make it a little easy to read.

15
00:01:07,918 --> 00:01:14,668
[BLANK_AUDIO]

16
00:01:14,668 --> 00:01:17,500
So let's declare a clock-in.

17
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:27,500
[BLANK_AUDIO]

18
00:01:28,584 --> 00:01:31,123
And a clock-out time.

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,020
And while we're at it let's declare some
more.

20
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,458
Let's do a seconds.

21
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:47,377
[BLANK_AUDIO]

22
00:01:47,377 --> 00:01:56,427
So, this is gonna hold the difference in
time in seconds,

23
00:01:56,427 --> 00:02:01,780
it would help if I spell it right.

24
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,293
And as you might guess, we'll do a
minutes.

25
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:09,336
[BLANK_AUDIO]

26
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:11,085
And then hours.

27
00:02:11,085 --> 00:02:21,085
[BLANK_AUDIO]

28
00:02:26,126 --> 00:02:30,833
Line it up, just so it looks a bit easier
to read, and we'll do the same over here.

29
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:35,667
[BLANK_AUDIO]

30
00:02:35,667 --> 00:02:37,250
And a bit easier on the eye.

31
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,585
Now, go down to the Code.

32
00:02:40,585 --> 00:02:50,833
[BLANK_AUDIO]

33
00:02:50,833 --> 00:02:53,917
And let's start filling some of these
fields with values.

34
00:02:53,917 --> 00:02:59,792
[BLANK_AUDIO]

35
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:03,372
So, our

36
00:03:03,372 --> 00:03:09,511
clocking time

37
00:03:09,511 --> 00:03:19,235
is equal 07:30.

38
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:24,667
That will equal 4 o'clock in the afternoon
for the clock out.

39
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:31,667
[BLANK_AUDIO]

40
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:36,708
And then, let's work out the difference in
seconds.

41
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:46,086
[BLANK_AUDIO]

42
00:03:46,086 --> 00:03:47,460
Let's see, if I got everything correct.

43
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,915
Almost, missed off the fields.

44
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,833
There we go and finally let's write out.

45
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:04,917
[BLANK_AUDIO]

46
00:04:04,917 --> 00:04:07,376
I'm gonna make it a bit more descriptive
eh?

47
00:04:07,376 --> 00:04:17,376
[BLANK_AUDIO]

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,305
There we go.
That should do it.

49
00:04:42,305 --> 00:04:46,424
So, we're going to write out a bit of text
to say the clock-in time was and

50
00:04:46,424 --> 00:04:50,345
then the clock-in, the clock-out time was,
and the clock-out and

51
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,625
then show us the difference in seconds.

52
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,941
I do apologize, I don't know what I'm
doing here.

53
00:04:57,941 --> 00:05:03,303
[LAUGH] I don't know why I've made the
seconds diff

54
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:11,700
equal to this, this should be a
calculation [UNKNOWN] before we run it.

55
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,125
See, it's clock-out minus clock-in.

56
00:05:14,125 --> 00:05:16,708
There we go.

57
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,935
So this should be 16:00 hours minus

58
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:26,167
07:30 giving us the difference in seconds.

59
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:28,417
Pretty it up.

60
00:05:28,417 --> 00:05:31,626
See if I made any mistakes.

61
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:35,750
As a bonus, now we'll test it.

62
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,251
So there we can see.

63
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,458
Clock-in time clock-out.

64
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:44,626
The difference is 30,600 seconds.

65
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:51,167
Now, is that correct?

66
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:51,850
Let's have a look.

67
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,710
So, we have 8 hours and 30 minutes.

68
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,360
So 8 times 60 plus

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:10,240
30 times 60 is 30,600 seconds.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,897
Let's not continue and work out, the
minutes difference and

71
00:06:18,897 --> 00:06:20,209
the hours difference.

72
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:24,167
[BLANK_AUDIO]

73
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:29,350
It's a simple calculation for the minutes.

74
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,132
Remember you must save your precious
fingers, so Copy and

75
00:06:32,132 --> 00:06:33,334
Paste as much as you can.

76
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:44,251
[BLANK_AUDIO]

77
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:48,042
All we need to do is reference our
seconds.

78
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:52,209
[BLANK_AUDIO]

79
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,130
And divide by 60.

80
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,782
So now we should see 33,600

81
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:06,660
seconds divided by 60 giving us I can't
remember what that calculation was.

82
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,960
Five, ten, was it?

83
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,000
Something like that then we'll write out.

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,292
[BLANK_AUDIO]

85
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:18,000
The difference in minutes this time.

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,709
[BLANK_AUDIO]

87
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:27,869
And while we're at it,

88
00:07:27,869 --> 00:07:32,458
let's do the hours calculation.

89
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:42,458
[BLANK_AUDIO]

90
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:55,834
And why not pretty it all up.

91
00:07:55,834 --> 00:08:05,834
[BLANK_AUDIO]

92
00:08:33,833 --> 00:08:34,667
Okay.

93
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,600
Pretty Printer.

94
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,990
We'll do a check, to see if I made any
mistakes.

95
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,620
And it looks like I did.

96
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,626
So, what did I call hours_diff?

97
00:08:45,626 --> 00:08:52,167
[BLANK_AUDIO]

98
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:54,530
Okay, I made a mistake up here by the
looks of things.

99
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,345
There we go, just 1s.

100
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Okay, everything is good this time.

101
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,570
Now let's test.

102
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:09,770
Oh, no doubt you've seen the mistake.

103
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,220
Here we want to output the minutes not the
seconds.

104
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,835
I guess this is what happens, when you
copy and paste too much.

105
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:24,083
[BLANK_AUDIO]

106
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,917
Okay.

107
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,833
Test it out this time.

108
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:33,626
[BLANK_AUDIO]

109
00:09:33,626 --> 00:09:34,917
There we go.

110
00:09:34,917 --> 00:09:41,500
So seconds through 30,600, minutes 510 and
hours 9.

111
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,542
[BLANK_AUDIO]

112
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,083
And I see I even made the spelling mistake
there too.

113
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:54,709
[BLANK_AUDIO]

114
00:09:54,709 --> 00:10:00,442
So, if we have 510 minutes difference, and
hours wasn't 9 exactly,

115
00:10:00,442 --> 00:10:04,820
but can you see why why we were given 9 as
the answer?

116
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:09,500
Hopefully, you recognize that the hours
diff was an integer.

117
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:16,160
If we'd made it a decimal, we would have
got a decimal result.

118
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:19,110
Giving us eight and a half hours
difference.

119
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,700
But, because it was an integer it was
rounded up to 9.

120
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:28,120
You want to check it out, let's change
that integer to a decimal.

121
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,940
So what we need to do, is moved to the
data declaration part, and

122
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:40,320
where we have an integer, let's change it
to a pac decimal.

123
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,480
And remember, we need to specify how many
decimal places we want.

124
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,958
We'll put 2.

125
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:55,584
[BLANK_AUDIO]

126
00:10:55,584 --> 00:10:58,460
Everything looks good, we'll activate it
and then test it out.

127
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:03,043
And as you can see, the results now is 8.5
hours.

128
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:07,689
[BLANK_AUDIO]
