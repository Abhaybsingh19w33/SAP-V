This command is used to remove superfluous spaces from a string. 
After using the condense statement, all the words in the string are separated by 1 blank space only.
Eg:	 data : alpha(20) value ‘lets get      on-line whatsay??’.
	condense alpha.
	write alpha.
Will display
lets get on-line whatsay??
