Whenever we declare internal tables or variables or constants, 
system will allocate memory to each one based on the size 
of the object while runtime.
For variables and constants we can determine 
the size from the definition. 

For internal tables, size will be equal to 
sum of sizes of all fields. 
i.e. size of one row equal to sum of sizes of all fields. 
Size of table equal to Size of each row * Number of rows.

begin of .. with OCCURS statement is used to define an implicit work 
area called header line while defining internal table. 
 
OCCURS 0 is used to allocate initial memory of 8KB to the 
internal table. 
If the data loaded in the internal table
exceeds 8 kb, another 8 kb of memory is allocated 
and the process continues.

OCCURS n, The value specified in n identifies number of 
expected records in the internal table. 
If the number of records exceeds, 
then the system will allocate memory for next n records. 

If the value of n is zero then it means that you don't know 
how many records you are going to get. 
So the system will allocate default memory of 8KB. 

Use OCCURS 0 only if you are sure that your table contents crosses 8KB at some point. 
Otherwise it will be simply waste of resource (Memory) while executing the program.
